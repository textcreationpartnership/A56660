            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>DO not throw away this little Book as ſoon as ever thou meeteſt with ſomething that offends thee; but ſit down rather, and conſider upon what account thou art offended. If it be onely becauſe the Author contradicts thy Opinions, and perhaps accuſes them of folly, thou haſt cauſe to turn thy displeaſure from him upon thy ſelf, for preſuming ſo much of thy own infallibility: which if thou wilt not pretend unto, then read on further, and conſider whether he contradicts thee with reaſon, or without: and howſoever it prove, thou wilt not repent thee of thy pains. For if he reprove thy Opinions without reaſon, thou wilt be more confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in them; if with reaſon, thou maiſt <pb facs="tcp:110369:3"/>exchange them for better. It is poſſible, indeed, that ſome things may ſeem to be expreſſed too tartly and ſeverely, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers too lightly and merrily: but let not that put thee out of humour neither, nor make the reaſon which is offered leſs conſiderable. For the Author (I can aſſure thee) hath no gall in him, nor was in any paſſion when he write theſe things: but intended onely (as naturally as he could on a ſudden) to expreſs ſuch Diſcourſe as Neighbours are wont to have in their private converſation; in which if there be nothing that is ſmart or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, they can ſcarce keep one another from ſleeping. He is very well aware under what great prejudices we all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and conſiders how hard it is to diſpoſſeſs an Opinion, though falſe, nay <pb facs="tcp:110369:3"/>ridiculous, which a man hath ſuck'd in with his mothers milk, and which hath been impreſsed on him by education, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by cuſtom, much encouraged by the conſent and practice of thoſe with whom he daily converſes, and hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps his complexion and natural temper to befriend it, and incline him to it. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch conſiderations as theſe he cannot be angry with thoſe againſt whom he writes; but rather pities them, and is ſorry they conſider not ſuch things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and ſo repreſs that heat and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion wherewith they advance their own private late inventions, againſt publick Decrees and ancient Conſtitutions. One ſort of men (he confeſſes) are apt a little to move his indignation, who pretend to the greateſt niceneſs of conſcience, and <pb facs="tcp:110369:4"/>have handled the matter ſo as to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thought the moſt religious of all others; and yet make no ſcruple to do thoſe things continually which are utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to good conſcience. (So, I believe, an underſtanding <hi>Heathen</hi> or <hi>Turk</hi> would reſolve, were he made judge in the caſe, and had firſt their Principles, and then their Practices, laid before him.) Such the Author thinks deſerve to be rebuked; and if there be any thing ſpoken with ſharpneſs in the enſuing Diſcourſe, it is when he hath to do with them. Yet in that caſe he hath uſed due moderation, not ſtudying to vex men, but onely to awaken and convince them. For he is very ſenſible that when we go about to displace any Opinion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce another in its room, we uſually <pb facs="tcp:110369:4"/>loſe our labour, if we either fail to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound our mind dexterouſly, or uſe not ſuch meekneſs as may ſhew we have a good will to thoſe from whom we differ. Where theſe are wanting, inſtead of inviting men to receive a Truth, we find they are commonly further alienated from it. Now he hath ſome confidence he is not much defective in the first, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken care to expreſs his mind clearly and in plain words, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Diſcourſe into the form of a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, to make it more eaſily apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As for the Later, he cannot but think that he hath done his duty, and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his kindneſs every where, even to thoſe againſt whom thou mayeſt think him moſt ſevere. But if thou judgeſt otherwiſe, then he earnestly beſeeches thee <pb facs="tcp:110369:5"/>to overlook it and paſs it by, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate and haſty expreſſion; and to weigh rather what Truth is here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to thee, than in what manner it is delivered.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, If it had not been to fill up ſome vacant pages, he had made almoſt as ſhort a Preface as thoſe words of the Son of
<hi>Sirach</hi> (according to which he expects the ſucceſs of his labour)
<hi>Ecclus. 21.15. If a skilful man hear a wiſe word, he will commend it, and add unto it: but as ſoon as one of no underſtanding heareth it, it diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him, and he caſteth it behind his back.</hi>

               <p>Nay, ſtay a little, and hear me out. How can he be the Miniſter of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to his Sovereign, whom

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Diſobedient? Yes, in thoſe things which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath forbidden him to do. And therein I hope you will be content he ſhould

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I knew this would be your anſwer. But, what if I prove that he is diſobedient even there where <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Laws are not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>You cannot do it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Why, what Law of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is there that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires him to live in <hi>London,</hi> or at leaſt within five miles of it?</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>But the Law of the Land forbids him to live in this place, or within ſuch a diſtance. And <pb n="3" facs="tcp:110369:8"/>yet notwithſtanding he lives here in defiance of that Law (which you confeſs is not contrary to
<hi>Chriſt</hi>'s. And being here, he lives alſo in the breach of a great many other Laws.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Very good. But it is not repugnant, you are convinced, to the Commands of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and therefore he is not a good Subject, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not a good Chriſtian; much leſs ſuch a perſon, as a Miniſter of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ought to be.</p>

                  <hi>I</hi> do moſt readily, and hope you ask God pardon for this, and all other your raſh words and actions. But that <hi>I</hi> may a little further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of that we were ſpeaking of; <hi>I</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you tell me, what Law of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is there that enjoyns him whom you follow to hold his Aſſemblies juſt then, when the publick Service of God, eſtabliſhed by Law, begins? Is not this ſufficient to convince any unprejudiced man, that he is not content to enjoy his own way of worſhipping God, but he would alſo deſtroy <pb n="4" facs="tcp:110369:9"/>ours? That is, not only to act contrary to a Law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I mean that which the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> meant, who had this <hi>Demonſtration of the Sipirit, and of Power;</hi> which he gave the world, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was riſen from the dead, and was made Lord of all, whom they were therefore bound to obey.</p>

               <p>Pray tell me what that is. Only let me deſire you not to uſe words, without the ſenſe belonging to them; and to intreat your Miniſter, that he would hereafter forbear to pray to God that he may ſpeak in the

            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I mean, that he is ſpiritually enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>ſearch the deep things of the Spirit of God, which the natural man cannot diſcern.</hi>

               <p>Theſe are phraſes which <hi>I</hi> would have you explain if you can.

               <p>Truly, if you have any other manner of underſtanding beſides this, and have not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt; I conclude you take the ſudden (and many times pretty) ſuggeſtions of Imagination to be Illuminations from above.</p>

               <p>Now you have hit on ſomething that <hi>I</hi> would have ſaid: The Spirit doth often dart things into my mind.</p>

               <p>How know you that? Do you take every thing that comes into your head you know not how, to be an Irradiation from the Holy Ghoſt?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>N.C.</speaker>
               <p>No, <hi>I</hi> dare not ſay ſo.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Then you examine it, and conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be rational and coherent, or no.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>N.C.</speaker>

            <sp>

               <p>Then you fall into our way whether you will or no. And whatſoever you think of us, we do not deny but God's good Spirit puts good
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:110369:11"/>thoughts oft-times in our minds, and repreſents things more clearly to us than we could make them by all our reaſonings: which is as much as to ſay, that it lets us ſee the reaſonableneſs and aptneſs of ſuch a Senſe (for inſtance) of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Writings as we diſcerned not before.</p>

               <p>You might hear ten times as much, if you would but frequent our Aſſemblies.

            <sp>
               <speaker>N.C.</speaker>
               <p>You mix ſo much of Reaſon with what you ſay, that I am afraid you are not in the right.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>N.C.</speaker>
               <p>Say you ſo? How then ſhall I believe that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the Son of God? Can Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon tell me this?</p>

               <p>I am ſorry to ſee you ſo ill inſtructed. If you had continued to hear our Miniſter, he would have made you underſtand before this time, that though our reaſon could not find out that Truth, yet God hath given us the higheſt reaſon to believe it.

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>The Holy Ghoſt (<hi>I</hi> mean) deſcended on our Saviour at his Baptiſm, with a voice from Heaven, ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> This is one reaſon we have to believe on him. Then he wrought miracles by the power of this Spirit; and though he was killed, yet he was raiſed again from the dead by it; and after that he ſent the Spirit upon his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, who thereby <hi>demonſtrated</hi> that he was <hi>the Son of God with power.</hi> Which are all reaſons for my belief; and if you have any other I would gladly hear them, or know whether you believe without any Reaſon at all.</p>

               <p>I like your Language very well: only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that theſe are the Divineſt Reaſons which cannot be reſiſted. For thus our mind ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues with it ſelf: That which God teſtified by voices from Heaven, and by a world of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, is to be believed; that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is his Son, he did in this manner teſtifie; therefore we are to believe that he is God's Son.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I have been taught, that there are two wayes to come at the Affections: One by the Senſes and Imagination; and ſo we ſee people mightily affected with a Puppet-play, with a Beggar's tone, with a lamentable Look, or any thing of like nature. The other is, by the Reaſon and Judgment, when the evidence of any Truth convincing the Mind, engages the affections to its ſide, and makes them move according to its direction. Now, I believe your Affections are moved in the firſt way very often; by melting Tones, pretty Similitudes, riming Sentences, kind and loving Smiles, and ſometimes diſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſad Looks; beſides ſeveral Actions or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures which are very taking. And the truth is, you are like to be moved very ſeldom in our Churches by theſe means. For the better ſort of Hearers are now out of love with theſe things: nor do they think there is any power either in a puling and whining, or in roaring <pb n="16" facs="tcp:110369:15"/>and tearing voice. But if you can be moved by ſuch ſtrength of reaſon, as can conquer the Judgment, and ſo paſs to demand ſubmiſſion from the Affection; you may find power enough (<hi>I</hi> think) in our Pulpits. And let me tell you, the Paſſions thus excited differ as much from the other, as the motions of a Man do from them of a Beaſt, if not more. For one may be affected, whether he will or no by Objects of Senſe: but Reaſon convinces and moves us by ſober conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and laying things ſeriouſly to heart. And <hi>I</hi> wiſh heartily you would examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the cauſe why you was no more affected with our preaching, was not this, That you took no pains with your ſelf; <hi>i. e.</hi> you would not be a Man, but was contented to be moved in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion like a meer Puppet, whoſe motions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the power of other Agents, and not its own.</p>

               <p>It is ſo. But that is an impertinent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from his former diſcourſe. For a man may ſerve God upon the account of Reward, and yet not be ſo fooliſh as to imagine he can earn any thing of him.</p>

               <p>One flaw? Read the reſt, and you will find that it is no wiſer. For he would have us immediately after to receive this as another note of a Legal ſpirit, that it is a <hi>fearing ſpirit,</hi> put on rather by the Threatnings, than the Promiſes; and the Goſpel ſpirit rather by Promiſes than Threatning.</p>

               <p>No. For our Saviour bids his Diſciples again and again to

<hi>the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Diſpenſations is, that the one is terrible, the other comfortable;</hi> it is manifeſtly falſe. For the Goſpel ſpeaks a great deal more terribly, than the Law doth, to Hypocrites and Unbelievers.</p>

               <p>This is nothing to his buſineſs. For he was not ſpeaking concerning the fears, which a Soul hath about its eſtate; but of the Principle upon which a man doth his duty. And, if I underſtand any thing, a Chriſtian is moved by <hi>fear,</hi> as well as <hi>hope.</hi>

               <p>I tell you again this is impertinent; for theſe are not motives to his Duty, but rather hindrances and impediments, as he will tell you. And beſides, he makes them to be cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs fears; for, he ſaith, they are the fears of <hi>a man that ſtands upon a rock;</hi> and therefore he ought not to be troubled with them.

<hi>fear,</hi> (<hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.1.) (and tells us there is cauſe for it)
<hi>leſt a Promiſe being left us of entring into reſt, any of us ſhould ſeem to come ſhore of it: and to work out our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with fear and trembling:</hi> and, <hi>to have grace to ſerve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.</hi> Mind this laſt place, and tell me if it do not directly oppoſe what he ſaith.

               <p>Now you have mended the matter finely; and made it plain, that he thinks all the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are abſolute. Which how well it agrees with their being Conditional, I pray tell me, when you have thought of it, at our next meeting.</p>

               <p>No indeed; for it is certainly falſe. He promiſes (for inſtance) Eternal life if we repent and effectually believe, and not otherwiſe. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance therefore and Faith are the Conditions of that Promiſe.

But he requires us to conſider and lay to heart what is ſpoken to us by his Son <hi>Jeſus;</hi> which is as much as to ſay, that upon this Condition he will work Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Faith in us.</p>

               <speaker>N.C.</speaker>
               <p>He doth ſo. <hi>But though the Promiſe runs conditionally, yet</hi> he tells us, <hi>it ſhall be fulfilled abſolutely.</hi>

               <p>You mean, <hi>W.

And ſuch was the confidence of theſe men, both in inventing ſtrange Language, and proclaiming their great Diſcoveries every where, that the poor people were perſwaded, the Nation never knew what Communion with God meant till this time.

<hi>Chriſt</hi> advanced to his Throne; and when they ſhould have ſuch Incomes, in dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and I know not how many other fine things, as never was the like heard of before. For one man comes and tells them of the

               <p>Sure they all came out of their School. For they taught men firſt to deſpiſe ſober and plain Doctrine, which teaches them their Duty toward God and their Neighbour, entertaining them with finer Speculations of pretended Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Myſteries and Manifeſtations; with which
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:110369:26"/>we heard almoſt every Sermon ſtuffed: ſo that he was thought no body that had not good ſtore of them. Now as thoſe you admire found they could win no great number of Proſelytes, unleſs they left the old track of Preaching Sobriety, Juſtice, Charity, and Godlineſs: ſo their Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars found in a little time that the new Notions and Language of their Maſters were grown ſtale; and that unleſs they invented newer, at leaſt coined ſome other Phraſes, their Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would be but ſmall. And thus it came to paſs, that every one, ſtriving not ſo much to ſpeak what would profit, as what would pleaſe, dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up Religion in affected Language of his own making; and new Expreſſions, if not new Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were heaped one upon another every year; till none knew what Chriſtianity was. For at laſt there aroſe a Company of fine Youths, who judged even their Maſters to be in a low and dull Form of Religion, <hi>ſticking in the beggerly Elements,</hi> and <hi>the dead letter,</hi> and <hi>the Old-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament ſpirit,</hi> as their manner of ſpeaking was. Theſe imagine that not only we, but you, know <hi>Jeſus</hi> only in the
<hi>Fleſh,</hi> and ſtand in the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court,</hi> and are not yet come within the <hi>Veil</hi> to diſcern the <hi>Spirit</hi> and the
<hi>Myſtery,</hi> which they alone bring to light. Such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs doth Fancy make, when once it is let looſe, and men are taught not to
<hi>reaſon,</hi> but to <hi>believe,</hi> there is no end of its Follies; and God only knows when this Nation, which is overflowed <pb n="39" facs="tcp:110369:26"/>with them, and is made fond of them, will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a more ſober mind.</p>

For you firſt taught the people to forbear all expreſſion of Devotion when they came into the Church, and decried the reverence of uncovering the Head there as Superſtitious and abominable. And ſo they ſoon took the liberty to come talking into the Church, and not onely to walk with their Hats on to their Seats (even when the Miniſter was reading the Holy Scriptures) but keep them half on when he was at Prayer. And then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe others were wont to kneel, or at leaſt Stand, in that holy Duty; they would ſhew their Liberty, or their Oppoſition (I know not whether) in Sitting, nay in Lolling after a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy faſhion, as if the Miniſter were telling a ſleepy Tale, not praying to our Creatour. In ſhort, there were no bounds could be ſet to their Extravagancies; but they found out as many new Geſtures, and odd phrantick Expreſſions, in their Prayers, as before they had done in their Preaching.</p>

                  <hi>I</hi> have been taught to do ſo. For this great Lord always <hi>loved righteouſneſs, and hated iniquity: and therefore God hath anointed him with the oyl of gladneſs above his fellows; i. e.</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him ſuch a Royal Power in the Heavens, (<hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.9.) Unto which glory we cannot be promoted but by the ſame way of Righteouſneſs. And let me tell you, <hi>I</hi> think <hi>I</hi> have heard it cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly demonſtrated, that though there is infinite comfort and ſatisfaction in believing that our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> is ſo exaled, and hath made us ſuch promiſes, which he is able to make good; yet all this is but to incourage our Obedience, and to make us conſtant and firm in the Chriſtian Religion, notwithſtanding all the Difficulties and Troubles we meet withall for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſake. So <pb n="34" facs="tcp:110369:28"/>that in truth theſe are the moſt <hi>ſpiritual Preachers,</hi> that is, the beſt Interpreters of the mind of the Spirit, who urge and preſſe men, from the conſideration of what God hath revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to us in theſe matters, to be <hi>ſtedfaſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, and abundant in the work of the Lord, knowing that our labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord.</hi>

               <p>An effectual perſwaſion that God hath ſent
<hi>Jeſus</hi> into the world, as he there tells you, <hi>This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath ſent.</hi> And if you can think he means a bare perſwaſion of this, that God ſent him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the effects and fruits of it, which is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming his Diſciples ſincere profeſſion of his Religion, and living according to it; then the Devil may be a good Believer, a very Spiritual perſon and great Saint, for he very early acknowledged Him to be the Son of God.

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I caſt my eye caſually upon one place in the Book newly nam'd, and there I found this Myſtery; <hi>That though there is a Condition in the new Covenant, yet no Condition to be perform'd by us, but by</hi> Chriſt <hi>our ſecond</hi> Adam: <hi>pag.</hi> 69. And though he confeſſes ſomthing muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by us, yet he ſaith, it is all promiſed to us, and that without Condition. And therefore a little after he makes this a mark of thoſe that are in Covenant, <hi>to be begot again by a Promiſe, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the abſolute Promiſe: pag.</hi> 72. Now ſince no Condition is to be performed by us, why ſhould any perſon take any care about it? or why ſhould any one trouble himſelf about doing that, which is already done for him, or, if it be not done, is promiſed that it ſhall be done? eſpecially ſince his great work is (as you ſay) only to cloſe with the promiſe, to lay hold upon the abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? For no body being named particularly in the promiſe, nor any quallification ſuppoſed in any man whereby he may know that he is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the Bleſſing rather than another; no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be given why all ſhould not apply it to themſelves, though never ſo bad; nay, why <pb n="45" facs="tcp:110369:29"/>they ought not to apply it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N.C.</speaker>
               <p>No, that is too great a boldneſs; they muſt be humbled and caſt down—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Then it ſeems they ought to feel ſome Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification in themſelves, which incourages them to lay hold on the Promiſe. Though, if it be abſolute, it's more than needs, nay, than is good: for they ought to have no reſpect to any of thoſe things, but only the Freeneſs of the Promiſe. And then I pray why might not a Devil remain ſo ſtill?</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Grant that. Yet if they do, it is no Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to them, according to your Doctrine; and therfore if they doe not, it ought to be no Diſcouragement. For they ought not to take any confidence to go to God becauſe anything they find in themſelvs; and therefore they may be confident, though they find nothing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevles but only a ſtrong fancy that the Promiſe belongs to their Perſons.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Will he have it ſo in order to give them Confidence to hope in his Mercy that their ſins ſhall be forgiven?</p>

               <p>Yes, I underſtand that it was the riches of God's Grace, to make a Covenant of ſaving thoſe Sinners who would obediently believe on his Son. For this was more than he was bound to grant; and this Believing and Obedience can deſerve nothing of him (it being a Duty to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what he reveals, &amp; to do what he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns;) and beſides, he gives us the means of Faith, and Helps to well-doing,</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I have told you, that we cannot do any thing for to deſerve it; and what we do he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables us to perform it And therefore it is free; becauſe when we have done all, yet he is no way tied to give us any thing, but only upon the account of his own moſt gracious Promiſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N.C.</speaker>
               <p>You grant then his Promiſe is from meer Grace.</p>
            </sp>

               <p>No body doubts of it that <hi>I</hi> know of.

            </sp>

               <p>But according to your Opinions, that is a thing which they need not conſider when they apply the Promiſes of Salvation to themſelves. For you ſay, they muſt have reſpect to abſolute promiſes; which you know have nothing to do with any Qualification for this Favour. In pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of which Doctrines you perſwade your ſelves that Aſſurance of God's Love is not to be grounded upon any Grace wrought in us; but only upon the Teſtimony of the Spirit, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading us that our Perſons are beloved, and that the Promiſes are made to us.</p>

               <p>Commonly they are no more.

               <p>If there be any that can be thought a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground, of God's withdrawing himſelf, ſure it muſt be ſome provoking Sin which they have committed.

All the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion that ever I could find for ſuch black thoughts is, but ſome ſuch thing as this, that they have not ſuch Inlargments as they were wont; or cannot go to Duty with that delight which formerly they took in it: which your Miniſters ought to teach them, are no Reaſons, but only melancholick Conceits. And if theſe be the things you call Experiences, there are none of us but underſtand them, as well as you, finding the ſame Dulneſs and Heavineſs in our ſelves. Only we are taught not to talk or complain of it, but to do our duty notwithſtanding as well as we are able, and we ſhall find it will not laſt alway.</p>

               <p>It is you, that have compelled me, as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did <hi>S. Paul</hi> by undervaluing him. And if you think me a fool in this (as well as other things) I am in a worſe conditon than that great Apoſtle thought he might be: Read his diſcourſe in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16, 17, &amp;c. and give me leave to ſpeak to you a little in his words. You are a wiſe ſort of people, and ſo can be content now and then to <hi>ſuffer fools gladly.</hi> For <hi>you ſuffer if a man bring you into bondage</hi> to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Opinions of his own, which make it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for you to do or not to do that which God hath not tied you unto. <hi>If a man devour you,</hi> by living continually upon you; <hi>If he take of you,</hi> Gold, Silver, and other gifts whereby he muſt be maintained; <hi>If he exalt himſelf,</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding perhaps, to more of the Sprit, and a more ſpecial Miſſion from God, than other men have; <pb n="54" facs="tcp:110369:34"/>ſtill you ſuffer him very patiently.

And beſide, they are more peaceable, more obedient to Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, more reſpectful to their Superiours, more modeſt in their Inquiries and Reſolutions about difficult Points, more charitable to thoſe that diſſent from them, and more deſirous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks to edifie, rather than to humour the people. For they do not ſeek to pleaſe their itching Ears, and gratifie the longings of their Fancies with new-found words, affected Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and odd Phraſes; but tell us thoſe things that concern our Saviour and his holy Life in plain &amp; proper Language. Which, I proteſt fills me with joy and gladneſs whenſoever I think of it. And it makes me conclude they have much Experience of the things of God becauſe they make me ſo feelingly conceive what the pleaſure and contentment is of being meek and lowly, ſober and chaſte, contented and heavenly-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and above all things, of having an heart inlarged with great Charity to all men, ſo as to <pb n="55" facs="tcp:110369:34"/>be ready to forgive, and to do good. This holy diſpoſition, you cannot deny, muſt needs make them capable to underſtand the Mind of God revealed to us in his Word; which book
<hi>I</hi> obſerve they are very careful we ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand aright, and not interpret and apply it, as I ſee you do, according to our Fancy. For you conceive that, becauſe <hi>S.

               <p>Well, I ſee my miſtake in that. But ſay what you will, your Preachers never had ſuch a <hi>Seal to their Miniſtry</hi> as God hath given ours, by converting thouſands through their means.</p>

               <p>Then all thoſe men who turn people may ſay that they have a

               <p>But you miſtake me, Sir; They do not only convert men to our Party, but to to be good <pb n="56" facs="tcp:110369:35"/>They really turn them from ſin to God.</p>

               <p>I am glad to hear it.

So I am ſure you confeſs it is with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who make men ſometime more civil in one regard, but more uncivil, than ever in others.</p>

               <p>It will be fit for you to examine yourſelvs throughly in this Point; Whether, for inſtance, many among you are not converted from loving the World, to hate their Neighbours; from cold Devotion at our Churches, to a fiery Zeal againſt our Miniſters; from Undutifulneſs to Natural Parents, to the greateſt Contempt of Civil and Spiritual. Nay, is this never made a Note of a man converted, that, though he have a great many Faults, yet he is wrought to Antipathy to Biſhops, Common-Prayer, an innocent Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſock, and a Surcingle, as you are pleaſed in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion to call our Miniſters Girdles?</p>

               <p>I think we are agreed that a <hi>Time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver</hi> is one who complies with the naughty Humors of the time for his own profit, and meddles not with the reigning ſins, for fear of offending his good Maſters by whom he is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.

               <p>Charge me with that, if you can, when I have done. And let me ask you, whether you are not ſatisfied that the ſins of <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> or <hi>Diſobedience to Governours,</hi> are very heinous; and whether it be not apparent that their was great need, in the beginig of the late Times, to warn the Nation to take heed of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving themſelves in that Guilt which ſeveral conſiderable perſons were runing headlong into <pb n="85" facs="tcp:110369:36"/>I think you will not oppoſe me in either of theſe, and I take your ſilence for Conſent. And then I dare appeal to you, whether your Divines were not very meal-mouth'd, as we uſe to ſpeak, and afraid theſe words ſhould come within their lips, even then when they ſaw theſe Sins come to their full groowth Nay, <hi>I</hi> affirm that you ſhall ſcrace find mention of them in their Writings, much leſs was any thing heard of them in their Sermons. Which is an evidence to me, that either they had not ſound and good Conſciences, or that they wanted Courage, and contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs to ſwim along with the Stream. And in the firſt place, let me tell you ſomthing that hath been obſerved of their unworthy Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the <hi>Sacrilegious</hi> humour of thoſe times. A worthy Miniſter of my acquanitance once told me, that your Aſſembly-men or other Divines, who wrote the <hi>larger Annotations upon the Bible,</hi> (of the Edition <hi>An.</hi> 1646) are very guilty in this point. For where there is a fit oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, ſaid he, to ſpeak againſt Sacrilege, and where other Expoſitors are wont to declare the foulneſs of the Sin, there they ſay not a word, but paſs it quite over, as if they knew of no ſuch thing in the world. Though he wouldnot impute it to their ignorance, but to their baſe Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe and flattering diſpoſition, which was loath to diſpleaſe the Lords of that Time.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I'll tell you ſome of the places, he inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:110369:36"/>in. Firſt, that known place <hi>Act.</hi> 5. where he told me in that Edition of 1646. there is no mention made of their Sacrilege, and defraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God of that which was devoted to him, (though that was their chief Crime) but onely of their Hippocriſie, Covetouſneſs, and Lying I muſt confeſs <hi>I</hi> have not the Book, and therefore you muſt take his word for it But thus much <hi>I</hi> will tell you upon my own knowledge; that having occaſion once to look upon their Annotations, (and that of the third Edition, much inlarged) upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.22. where there was a fitter occaſion to ſay ſomething of this Sin, than in the former place, becauſe the very word <hi>Sacrilege</hi> is here mentioned, <hi>I</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved (<hi>I</hi> well remember) that theſe tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger'd Gentleman would not ſo much as touch it, but fairly ſlipt over it. For they only ſpeak of the notion of the word in the Civill Law, (and that not directly) defining it, <hi>The taking away from the Emperour any thing that his is.</hi> Would not this make one think that they were very much afraid to meddle with this Sin?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Perhaps that is the meaning of <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,</hi> there.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>One can ſcarce believe it, who conſults the place; where the Apoſtle reprehends a manthat commits ſomthing of the ſame nature with tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, which he reproves another man for. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I doubt not but, thoſe who then cry'd out againſt Idols, and by no means would indure
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:110369:37"/>them in the Holy place, did diſcover their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs and diſreſpect to that place ſome other way, which in all likelihood was in not bringing their Offerings thither, but detaining from God that which was his own peculiar goods.

               <p>I, but ſome Annotations on a plain place make it more obſerved: and I am ſure they are large enough in their Deſcants upon as plain words as thoſe. And therefore why they ſhould forbear to ſay any thing there I cannot imagine, unleſs it were a fear of diſpleaſing the Parliament and many of their partakers. For as for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, I believe many of them would not have had the Lands ſold, but imployed to their uſe and benefit.</p>

               <p>Well, is this all?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>No, there is another remarkable place in the Book of
<hi>Joſhua,</hi> Chap. 6.19. where God commands all the Gold and Silver, &amp;c. which ſhould be taken in <hi>Jericho,</hi> to be conſecrated to him, and put into the Treaſury. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which we read that
<hi>Achan</hi> purloined 200 ſhekels of Silver and a wedge of Gold to his own private uſe, and was therefore ſeverely puniſhed, nay all the Congregation troubled for his offence, till he ſuffered for it,
<hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.21. And yet theſe men ſay not a ſyllable of this Sin in their Notes on either of thoſe verſes; though all other Divines are wont from thence to ſhew how dangerous it was then to rob God, and take
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:110369:38"/>a way what was ſeparated to his uſes. In other places I am ſure they oft make large Declamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt ſome Sins, and in a manner preach againſt them: and therfore why they ſhould not have a ſyllable to ſay here about this matter, is a great Myſtery, unleſs I have diſcovered the cauſe of it. As for that place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.22. I know you will ſay they were Idolatrous Prieſts whoſe Land
<hi>Joſeph</hi> ſold not. But methinks they needed not have made an excuſe (as they there do) for <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s not ſelling them as if it had been an act of greater Virtue, if he had. And methinks they ſhould have told the world pretty ſmartly that if <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had ſuch a reſpect to the <hi>Aegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian</hi> Prieſthood as not to ſell their Land; Chriſtian Princes &amp; Governours ſhould not be more unkind (if not unjuſt) in theſe days, nor expoſe to ſale thoſe Lands which have been ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled upon the Prieſts of the moſt High God. But above all, I wonder at their profound ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in their Notes upon <hi>Ezek.</hi> 48.14. where one would think at laſt they would have broken it; eſpecially ſince they might have done it pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſecurely in ſuch an obſcure place, which few read. There the Lands of the <hi>Levites</hi> are again forbidden to be ſold: And by <hi>Levites</hi> according to their own Principles we are to underſtand the Miniſters of the Goſpel, whoſe Lands there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to be ſold. I prove it clearly. thus, In the beginning of their Explication of this Viſion, they lay down this for a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:110369:38"/>of their Expoſition (Chap. 40.2.) that herein was repreſented the ample and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſtate of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Church, under the Types of the Re-building of the Temple, Reſtauration of the
<hi>Levitical</hi> Worſhip and Service, nad the Repoſſeſſion and Inhabitation of the whole Land. Which they repeat again Chap. 43.1. and in ſundry other places. If this be true, (as they believed it to be) then, according to their own Rules, the aſſigning of Land for the
<hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> muſt ſignifie the care that ought to be tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to ſettle a Maintenance for the ſupport of the Goſpel-Miniſtery and Service; and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition againſt ſelling the <hi>Levites</hi> Lands muſt denote the pleaſure of God, that the portion of Land or other things ſettled upon the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Prieſthood, or Miniſtery, ſhould never be alienated from them. Now I pray you tell me, why would they not open their mouths at laſt in ſo plain a caſe as this? What ſhould be the cauſe, that they do not ſo much as name this Sin, much leſs bid the World beware of it, and ſtill much leſs paſs any ſentence upon it? Do you think they did not know what is wont to be ſaid on theſe places? Did they not underſtand well enough, that if they would write conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to their own principles before laid down, they muſt either tax that Sin in this place of
<hi>Ezekiel,</hi> or elſe ſay juſt nothing? Why did they chuſe the later, and paſs it over with a word; but only referring us to two or three places <pb n="64" facs="tcp:110369:39"/>of Scripture nothing to the purpoſe?</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I'll tell you then. The moſt probable conjecture is that which I have made already, That they were afraid in the leaſt to diſpleaſe their maſters who ſet them on work. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament would have taken it very ill, and all the <hi>good people</hi> too, who, to ſave their own purſes, were content the Churches Lands ſhould be ſold to carry on the War which they had ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally begun.</p>

               <p>Since you love not to hear any thing of it, I am content to be as ſilent as your Minſters were wont to be: only let me tell you, I have obſerved ſeveral other things which they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, not becauſe they think it is their Duty, but for fear of diſpleaſing a party.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I mean, it was for this reaſon that they ſeldom or never (ſome of them) uſed the <hi>Lora's Prayer,</hi> becauſe the people had been taught on a ſudden to abhorr Forms, without remembring them that the Lord's prayer was a Form. It was not fit to tell them that, for fear they ſhould have continued to like other Forms of prayer for its ſake. I obſerve alſo, that ſtill they will by no means give the title of
<hi>Saint</hi> to one of the <pb n="65" facs="tcp:110369:39"/>Apoſtles or Evangeliſts of our Lord, (though I think they will call them <hi>Holy,</hi> which is the ſame) no not when they reade a Text out of their Writings. For which I can conceive no other reaſon, but their good Dames and Maſters do not like it. They are afraid that it is Popiſh. And rather than theſe
<hi>Men-ſervers</hi> will be at the pains of convincing them of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, or, to ſpeak more properly, rather than venture the danger of loſing them, (for many might in a paſſion fly off, if they heard the name of <hi>Saint</hi> given to any but themſelves) they will not offend their tender ears by naming that abominable word. And were it not that I am loath to try you, I could inſtance in a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things wherein they are meer Slaves to the humours of the people, and <hi>ſerve the time;</hi> not daring to ſay thoſe things, or to uſe thoſe words, which they know are fit to be ſaid and to be uſed, meerly becauſe many people will run away from them.</p>

               <p>You grow witty. But it will not ſerve your turn; for I ſhould think the principles are loſt as well as they. Elſe what's the cauſe you have none of them in your private Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where you may do what you liſt? Either you have deſerted thoſe Principles, or elſe your Covenant, which I am ſure you thought bound you to maintain theſe. Chuſe which part you will; for either of them will ſerve my turn.</p>

               <p>I think there were Orders in the late Times that no man ſhould pray publickly for <hi>King CHARLES;</hi> and they obey'd them.

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>That they have forſaken their Principles. For now they will not obey the King's Orders. Mark what I ſay: They would obey Uſurpers, becauſe they had a Power for the time being; and now they diſobey their Sovereign, whole Power they acknowledge to be juſt, and who commands things that are not unlawfull. As for example, they will not hear Common-Prayer, (at leaſt many of them do not) which they can if they liſt: nor will they obſerve an Holy-day, which is no more unlawfull to be kept, one would think, than one of thoſe thankſgivings. Give me a reaſon, for inſtance, why the <hi>Nine and twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of September</hi> may not as well be obſerved as the <hi>Third</hi> ſometime was.</p>

               <p>Do you like this Principle better, (which they will not forſake, I warrant you) <hi>That they are in God's way, and therefore ought to be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; whereas all others are our of his way, and

               <p>I'll tell you another then, that's more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and will pleaſe you better: <hi>That they muſt by all means keep you from coming to Church, for fear you ſhould ſee that you may be as well taught elſewhere as in their private Meetings.</hi>

               <p>Now you have revealed the Bottom of your heart.—Pardon me that ſudden con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; you may have more yet lurking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, which you have not told me.

For what have any of yours to qualifie them for the Miniſtry which ours have not as well as they? If you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the inward motions of the Spirit of God inclining a man to devote himſelf to this work; (which ſome of you think is enough) this ours profeſs to have felt, as you may ſee in the Form <pb n="80" facs="tcp:110369:48"/>of ordering Prieſts. If it be further neceſſary to be approved by Presbyters, and to have their hands laid on them; this is not wanting to ours, as you may there alſo be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>

               <p>And can this unhallow them, when they are ſo dedicated to God?</p>

               <p>Then you would ſooner believe what one of your own Party ſays without any reaſon, than what we ſay with all the reaſon in the world: which is plainly partial affection.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Is it not apparent that a Biſhop is a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter too? though we think him more.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>You acknowledge a diſtinction of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Church, which is Antichriſtian.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, then I have done with you. You condemn all the ancient Church of Antichriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm; and more than that, the very Apoſtles themſelves and the Evangeliſts, who it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt had ſome Superiority over their brethren. But obſerve whither you are run, having once left your way. You mix the very dregs of all other Sects with your own; and believe any thing that makes againſt us, even ſuch things as the Miniſter you commonly hear would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd to ſay. Firſt, you onely diſliked the Common Prayer; then you did not love the man <pb n="81" facs="tcp:110369:48"/>that read it; next you would not come to hear him; and now you will not allow him to be a Miniſter: nay rather than ſuffer him to enjoy that name, you will venture to deprive Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical men of their Office, who exerciſed an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over their brethren.</p>

               <p>No, nor do we <hi>ordain</hi> any <hi>Lords</hi> when we make Biſhops. That's an Honour which the King doth them, to qualifie them to ſit in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and adviſe about the Affairs of the Realm, in which they are as much concern'd as other men.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I thought thither would be your retreat. But why are not the Biſhops Godly too?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>They do not love and encourage good men.</p>

               <p>You ſtill ſuppoſe none are good but your ſelves; which is no great token of that Modeſty and Humility which we think neceſſary to make <pb n="82" facs="tcp:110369:49"/>a Godly man. But ſuppoſe any of them ſhould be ſo bad as not to countenance the very beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, but rather the worſt; yet this would be onely the fault of the <hi>Men,</hi> not of the

            <sp>

               <p>I have often heard that Diſtinction; but I could never love your Logick.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes ſometimes. For you once liked a more ſubtil Diſtinction than this, and that was between the <hi>King's perſonal and politick capacity—</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Pray forbear to ſcratch thoſe old ſores. But why do your Biſhops oppoſe all <hi>Praying by the Spirit?</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I thought you might come to that at laſt, &amp; I fanſie it is the great quarrel you have with the.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Then let me aſſure you, the <hi>Biſhops</hi> are the fartheſt of any men in the world from oppoſing <hi>Praying by the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>You tell me a thing incredible. I ſhould come ſometimes to hear your Miniſters but that they have not the Spirit of Prayer; which the
<hi>Biſhops</hi> (I ſuppoſe) ſuppreſs and keep down all they can.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Belike then you think that to <hi>pray by the Spirie,</hi> and
<hi>to have a Spirit of Prayer,</hi> are all one.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Why not? I know no difference.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Becauſe I am ſure ours have a Spirit of Prayer; but neither ours nor yours can pray by the Spirit. If they could, the Biſhops would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffer Martyrdom than oppoſe it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I apprehend you not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:110369:49"/>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Very likely: for I ſee you have been nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with phraſes, but underſtand very little.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Pray try if you can make me underſtand more, ſince it ſeems you are ſo skilful.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Hear me quietly then, and I will tell you what I have learn'd. For my skill is onely bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd from ſuch good men as our <hi>Pariſh Prieſt;</hi> whom you (I doubt) ſometime deride, and ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully call by that name.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I am in no paſſion: ſpeak your mind.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Tell me then; when a man reverently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes himſelf to God, ſeriouſly acknowledges his Authority over all, his Power, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs, profeſſes to depend upon him intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, dreads his Diſpleaſure, waits upon him for his grace and favour, hungers and thirſts after Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and devoutly renders his Thanks to the Poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth for all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits; hath he the Spirit of Prayer, or no?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot ſay but he hath, if his heart go along with his lips.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Then our Miniſters have the Spirit of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for in all appearance, and as far as we can judge, they have an inward ſenſe of theſe things when they pray. And as for their words and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, they are generally more reverent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming than yours.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Methinks you ſhould not be of that mind.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Truly I have heard ſuch bold, and ſometimes rude, things ſpoken by ſome of yours in Prayer, that I could not think they had any ſenſe and <pb n="84" facs="tcp:110369:50"/>feeling of God at all at that time. Their Geſtures alſo were ridiculous. Nay, I have ſeen ſome of them look about upon the people, (to ſee, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, how they were affected) when they ſhould have turn'd their eyes toward Heaven. Which was an argument to me they had ſomething elſe in their mind then, more than God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Then it ſeems you hear them ſometimes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Not now. But I have heard them heretofore, when they preached in our Churches.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>O! but if you could hear them now, you would ſay they are full of the Spirit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Becauſe they pour out ſuch abundance of words.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>No, but they are more <hi>earneſt</hi> than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and they
<hi>plead</hi> with God after a more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual manner.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>You call Loudneſs of ſpeech <hi>Earneſtneſs,</hi> which I always took to be the ardent deſire of our Souls after that good which we humbly beg of God. And as for their <hi>pleading</hi> with God, I think it is rather <hi>ſaucineſs.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Now you are bitter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>If I thought ſo, I ſhould condemn my ſelf as much as you can do; for I have learn'd, that we ought to <hi>put away all wrath, bitterneſs, cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and evil ſpeaking.</hi> Nay, if I thought I had done amiſs, I would ask forgiveneſs, not onely from God, but from you too.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>That is a good mind. But why d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, but not in your ſenſe. For he would willingly have maintained his innocency, and have had his Caſe argued, that he might make it appear he was not ſo guilty as his friends made him: Which is nothing to your purpoſe; who, I ſuppoſe, do not intend (though you call <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, a Days-man</hi> between God and us) to ſtand upon your defence, and juſtifie your ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. This you think too great a boldneſs, do you not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Why then may I not call it a Saucineſs in you to do a great deal more; I mean, to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God ſo much as you are wont, and to ask him over and over again what's the reaſon he doth not this or that, and why he ſuffers you to be ſo and ſo, and how he can deny you this or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Doth not <hi>David</hi> ſometimes ask queſtions?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, in a great agony of ſpirit, and upon ſome great occaſion: which will not warrant you to take this unheard of boldneſs. So I call it; becauſe things done in imitation of others, when we are not in that condition, and have not that occaſion, and that ſpirit alſo which they had, are very fulſome; no better than the motions of a Monkey when he imitates a man. To do thoſe things alſo commonly which thoſe great men did now and then, is monſtrouſly unbeſeeming. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, his Pſalms are pieces of Divine Poetry, in which Paſſions are wont to be expreſſed much <pb n="86" facs="tcp:110369:51"/>otherwiſe than they ought to do in plain and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar ſpeech. And yet you not onely venture to uſe their Figures of ſpeech, but you go beyond them. Like a man that having light upon a good Figure in Rhetorick, will never have done with it but is always touching upon it. Then which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more abſurd, eſpecially if he heap a great many of theſe Figures together, as your manner is, asking God over and over again, (as I ſaid) why he doth not this or that, and when he will do it. Beſides, that which in a great agony (as I ſaid) is very decent to be ſpoken, doth not befit a man's mouth at another time; but they that go about to imitate it, do a thing unnatural. And the truth is, you ſeem to me to endeavour by theſe queſtions to put your ſelves and the people into a great paſſion, and a kind of agony; but they do not ſpring (I perſuade my ſelf) nor ariſe of themſelves from any ardency of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But there is another thing that offends me more than all this; that having ſtirr'd up ſome confuſed paſſions in your ſelves by this and other ſuch like means, you proceed to ſuch an high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of confidence in this bold way of Arguing with God, that you quite forget who you are ſpeaking to. For ſome have told him that he little knew how his enemies inſulted, (or ſome ſuch thing;) and that if he did but know how deſirous they were of ſuch a thing, or how much they would prize it, he would not deny them.</p>

               <p>I tell you only what is credibly reported: and if it be not ſo, I ſhall be very glad. But I muſt adde, that they take ſuch a liberty of ſaying any thing to God, which they would ſay to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I conceive it not unlikely that ſome might fall into thoſe unſeemly (others perhaps will call them blaſphemous) expreſſions. Are not you of the ſame mind?</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Familiarity</hi> do you call it? would the world had never known it: For it is ſuch a one as hath bred in mens minds a contempt of God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. It hath taught every body to let that Member looſe which ought to be always bridled, eſpecially in God's preſence. They vent all their fooliſh Opinions to him; they tell him News, and inform him how things go abroad; which they have received many times upon a falſe report: which hath brought ſuch a ſcandal upon Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it cannot but grieve any good man's heart to think on't.</p>

               <p>It is falſe We reverence that Spirit which was in the Apoſtles; and if we could ſee ſuch an one again, none would entertain it with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er gladneſs. We acknowledge alſo the power of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:110369:52"/>the Spirit of God ſtill in the hearts of men, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of thoſe who are good; and we bleſs God continually for it. But that which we deny is this, That either you or we are able (as I told you)
<hi>to pray by the Spirit.</hi>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>No; we ſuppoſe there is no ſuch thing as Prayer by the Spirit: if there were, we ſhould reverence it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I mean a prayer immediately dictated by the Holy Ghoſt, as ſome were in the Apoſtles day.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Such a prayer, in which by the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt a man conceives thoſe things which he ſpeaks to God. Or (in plainer terms) I mean, that the Spirit of God doth not now ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to any of us (when we pray) the very matter and words which we utter. If you pretend to this then thoſe prayers are as much the Word of God as any of <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms, or as any part of the Bible; and (being written from your mouths) may become Canonical Scripture.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>But we do not pretend to this.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I wiſh then you would not talk as if you did. I am ſure, your diſcourſes of Prayer are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſuch, that one would think you took your ſelves to be full of the Holy Ghoſt. And this I muſt tell you hath made a great many ſcorn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, when they ſaw the Spirit of God intitled to ſuch pitiful ſtuff as they heard many vent with the greateſt confidence.</p>

               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>This is their own fault.</p>

               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot believe that our Prayers ever had any ſuch effect.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>But I can; and I will tell you how. You conſtantly tell us that the Biſhops by preſcribing a Form limit and ſtint the Spirit. By which Spirit you mean the Spirit of God, not your own. From whence it follows, that you think (or would have the world think) that the Spirit of God ſpeaks in you when you pray, and that you utter its mind and words. Now many men hearing you pray ſo inconſiderately and wildly, uttering moſt abſurd (if not impious) things, yet with a mighty zeal and confidence, have been tempted to think that whatſoever is ſaid of the Spirit, even in the Apoſtles days, might poſſibly be no more than ſuch an Extravagance and Fury as this.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>A moſt ſenſleſs conceit.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I think ſo too. But you have given occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſuch conceits in thoſe that are inclined to Infidelity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I hope not. For we onely mean, when we ſay we pray by the Spirit, that the Holy Ghoſt aſſiſts us</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>With what? Doth it furniſh you with words?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>No, with devout and ardent affections.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>This indeed you ſhould mean; but your brags of the Spirit import more.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Pray, Sir, uſe no ſuch reproachful words: we boaſt of nothing.</p>

               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:110369:53"/>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Well, pardon me that word. But if you do not brag, yet you ſay that you can <hi>pray by the Spirit,</hi> and we cannot, at leaſt do not. In which you aſcribe ſomething more to your ſelves than is to be found among us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Then you mean more by <hi>praying by the Spirit</hi> than being inſpir'd with devout Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For thoſe you cannot deny we may have as well as you; and unleſs you will take upon you to ſearch the heart, you muſt grant we feel them, ſince we proteſt that we do. From whence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, whatſoever you ſay, that your men would have you believe that it is the Spirit which ſpeaks in them and by them when they pray. Which is a thing that reproaches not only them, but the very Spirit of God, and (as I ſaid before) hath at leaſt confirm'd men in their Atheiſtical or unbelieving inclinations.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Well, I will not diſpute this with you any longer. But tell me ſeriouſly, do you think that men could pray with that readineſs and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and lenght, if they were not mightily aſſiſted by the Spirit of God?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes indeed do I. Their own ſpirits will ſerve them for this purpoſe; if they be but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with good phanſies, and a ſufficient meaſure of boldneſs. For it is a great vertue (I aſſure you) in this caſe not to be modeſt; though we reckon it a ſingular vertue to be ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot think it poſſible.</p>

            <sp>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:110369:53"/>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Why? Neighbour, you may take my word for this. There are many of our men could out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do you in this Gift (as you call it) of Prayer, if they would give themſelves the liberty; and yet you would not think them inſpir'd, I am ſure. I mean, they are able to ſpeak ſo readily and flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſo earneſtly and paſſionately of all manner of things, and to continue this ſtrain ſo long, and that without humming or hawing; that if you did not know them, perhaps you would admire them above moſt of your own.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Then I ſhould conclude they had the Gift of Prayer but ſuppreſs it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>So they have; but it is both in you and us onely a Natural gift, or acquir'd by Exerciſe, and Practiſe, and Imitation—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Now you ſpeak prophanely.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I ſpeak the ſenſe of the ſobereſt of your own Party, (as I verily believe) who would ſay the ſame, if they durſt but deal plainly with you. And (as ſimple as I am) I dare undertake to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the truth of what I ſay againſt any of them, if they have the face to contradict it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I ſee you leave the Spirit of God no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do in our Prayers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Would you would ſee how you forget your ſelf. Did I not tell you what the Spirit of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was? how that God beſtows it upon us, when he gives us a ſenſe of himſelf and of our needs, and ſtirs up in us holy deſires, and paſſionate longings after his Righteouſneſs; which we
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:110369:54"/>ſhould expreſs in ſuch words as are becoming that Majeſty with whom we have to do? And this is the reaſon that we take care to chuſe our words, and not leave them to extemporary invention, eſpecially in the publick Service of God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Do you think they will ever want Words whoſe hearts are full of Deſires? or can great Affections ever fail to furniſh us with plenty of Language?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, that they may. For all experience tells us, that very great and high Affections are too big for Words, and make a man at a ſtand for want of Expreſſions; which no man ſure will think a ſeemly thing in a publick Congregation. And the paſſions of Admiration and Reverence of God reſtrain a mans forwardneſs of ſpeaking to him, and make him like a few words beſt, which he is not then in a fit caſe to invent. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for leſſer Affections and ſuperficial Heats; I grant they ſeldom let a man want words (if he have tolerable Parts) and make him ſpeak more readily than he would do at another time: yet they are not able ever to furniſh him with thoſe that are fit, proper, and decent. Which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks ſhould make you not quarrel with a ſober form of words, at leaſt in our publick Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Would you could perſwade me that a Form of words is lawful to be uſed; it would go <pb n="93" facs="tcp:110369:54"/>a great way to perſwade me to come to your Church.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Strange that you ſhould be ſo inapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive! It is ſo lawful to uſe a Form of words, that I have ſhewn you it is in a ſort neceſſary: that is, we can have no ſecurity that the Service of God will always be performed well without one.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>N.C.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Obſerve then. I ſay, the beſt of men, though their hearts be full of good deſires, may, from ſome cauſe or other, want ſuch words as are fit and proper to expreſs their meaning. In this caſe they muſt hack in an unſeemly manner, or make a ſtop, or uſe ſuch words as are too rude and ſlovenly, or ſpeak broken and imperfect language, or at the beſt ſuch as is too hard and obſcure, and unintelligible by the Vulgar. None of which things are to be permitted in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip, which ought to be performed with the greateſt ſolemnity and gravity. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent that Undecency, and ſecure the Service of God from all that is unhandſome; you muſt conſent to a preſcribed Form of words, wherein men ſhall addreſs their humble and hearty Deſires to him. For though ſome men, at ſome times, may pray well enough; yet other men, and the ſame men at other times, may be very confuſed, and full of Tautologies; and it's well if they endeavour not to ſupply theſe defects with rude Clamours, brutiſh Noiſes, <pb n="94" facs="tcp:110369:55"/>and a deal of the Holy Scriptures wofully miſapplied. Beſide; how can you perſuade any ſtrangers to be of our Church, or to hold any Communion with us, if they do not know how we worſhip God? And how ſhould they know that, unleſs you can produce ſomething which by a general conſent is own'd for his Service? This no doubt is one reaſon why all Churches in the world have had their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Forms of Prayer, that they may let every body know how God is ſerved by them; and why the beſt men in Reformed Churches have wiſhed thoſe happy days might come of amity and friendſhip, that they might by a Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and Conſent form a certain Liturgy, which might be as a Symbol and Bond of Concord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them all. And truly I cannot adviſe how your Miniſters can juſtifie themſelves in ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting now from all the Reformed Churches, (as well as ours) with whom they covenanted to maintain an Uniformity, not onely in Doctrine and Diſcipline, but Worſhip alſo. To me they ſeem to live in an open breach of one branch of that Covenant, of which they are ſo tender. For they do not <hi>endeavour in their place and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to reform according to the example of thoſe Churches.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Themſelves and their Congregations, which they take the boldneſs to gather; who <pb n="95" facs="tcp:110369:55"/>ought to ſerve God (according to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) after the example of the beſt Reformed Churches; all of which have an Order and Form of Prayer, and never imagin'd that thoſe written Forms did bind up and ſtint the Spirit. This is a peculiar phanſie of your own, who have no Form at all in any of your Conventicles or Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; though it is in the power of your Miniſters to have one, as well as to hold ſuch Meetings; and though they be bound by their League and Covenant to do their endeavor to imitate thoſe that have. Nay, I much queſtion whether they uſe the Lord's Prayer. They that do (I believe) have the leaſt company; ſuch is the prejudice which they (contrary to their Covenant) have ſowen in peoples minds againſt Forms of Prayer, even that of the Lord's. Which thing conſidered, it makes me aſtoniſh'd at your impudence in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending ſuch niceneſs of Conſcience, and fear to break your Covenant; when you break it every time you meet together without ſome Form of Divine Service.</p>

               <p>Thoſe are Prayers and Petitions as well as Thankſgivings, are they not? And let me tell you, the words are ſo mean and ſometime uncouth, nay, the ſenſe of the Prophet ſo often miſtaken in that Tranſlation which is commonly uſed; that if you had ſo much to except againſt the Common Prayer, as may reaſonably be excepted againſt many things there, there would be no end of your Complaints; you would be ten times louder in your Clamours than you are.</p>

But pray think of it your ſelf hereafter; and tell me why it is not as lawful to uſe a Form of Prayer in Proſe, as to uſe one in Verſe. You will be a marvellous man, if you can ſhew a Reaſon of the Difference.</p>

               <p>You go too faſt; that is the Word of God, and therefore to be uſed; but any thing elſe uſed in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> I think we ſhould have nothing to do with.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>This is a fooliſh exception. For the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon you gave me concludes againſt the uſe of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> too, or elſe it concludes nothing: which I thus demonſtrate. You lay down this Propoſition,
<hi>Whatſoever is uſed in the Service of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church muſt not be uſed by us.</hi> To this I adde another; The <hi>Pſalms</hi> and other <hi>Scriptures</hi> are uſed in the <hi>Service of the</hi> Roman
<hi>Church.</hi> Now do you draw any other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion if you can from theſe two, but this, <pb n="98" facs="tcp:110369:57"/>That <hi>thoſe Scriptures muſt not be uſed by us.</hi> If you like not this Concluſion, then you muſt mend the firſt propoſition, (which is your own, and you may do what you will with it;) as for mine, it cannot be mended, for it is certainly true. Now how will you mend it, but by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing us the uſe of whatſoever is good in their Service? And then you muſt admit of more than the Scripture to be uſed by us, even all that is according to the Scripture: As our Prayers certainly are; though ſome of them are but Tranſlations of the
<hi>Latine</hi> Prayers uſed in that Church.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I will mend it in this manner: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they uſe (except it be the Word of God) we are not to uſe it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>It is meer Humour that makes you limit it in this manner. For there is ſomething good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Scripture. <hi>viz.</hi> that which is writ, ſaid, or done according to it. And why they ſhould make any thing of this nature unuſeful to us by their uſing it, ſince you confeſs the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, notwithſtanding their uſe, nay abuſes of it, is not prophaned thereby, is paſt my capacity to underſtand. But perhaps you will be more ſenſible of what I ſay, if I tell you, that upon theſe principles you muſt reject the uſe of the <hi>Creed,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> becauſe it is Profeſſed there in Divine Service as well as here.</p>

For this is the very bottom on which your Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſtands; that whatſoever hath been in uſe by a bad company of men, muſt by no means be uſed by us in God's Worſhip; except onely ſuch portions of Holy Scripture as ſhall be thought fit to be read in our Aſſemblies. From whence it follows, that you may not lift up your Eyes to Heaven, nor Kneel when you pray, nor—</p>

And the truth of it is, good men uſe that every day well which bad men uſe ill: And therefore I ſee not but we may do ſo with many things practiſed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Do not good men uſe the Name of God with Reverence, which wicked men continually blaſpheme? Do we not refreſh our ſelves with Meat and Drink, of which many Debauched perſons take a Surfeit?

               <p>This is the wildeſt phanſie that we have yet heard, as many of our Miniſters have ſhewn by unanſwerable Arguments. For it makes that unlawful which the Scripture allows; in which we find many Holy men doing thoſe things (without any cenſure) in God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which he had no where commanded. Nay, it makes the Worſhip of God impoſſible; the Time, the Place, the Veſture in which it ſhall be performed being no where appointed. It condemns alſo the beſt Chriſtians in all Ages till of late, who without any ſcruple uſed Forms of Prayer, and ſuch Rites as thoſe about which there is all this ſtir. And, which perhaps will moſt move you, I have heard our Miniſters ſhew that this Principle doth condemn your ſelves, who (when you take an Oath) do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſe to lay your Hand upon the Book, and kiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q rend="inline margQuotes">
                     <note place="margin">☞</note> Now all agree that an Oath is a ſolemn act of Divine Worſhip, it being an acknowledgment of all God's Attributes, and he being invocated and call'd upon to be a Witneſs and a Judge in the caſe. And if that be an act of Worſhip, I am ſure, Kiſſing the Book and Laying on the Hand are as much Ceremonies as Signing with the Croſs; outward ſigns (I mean) accompanying the action of Swearing, though they belong not to the Eſſence of it. And I am as ſure that <pb n="103" facs="tcp:110369:59"/>you can no where ſhew me that God hath commanded this Religious action to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this Ceremony.</q> Behold then, into what perplexities theſe men caſt you!

<hi>Abraham</hi> made his Servant put his Hand under his Thigh when he ſware, though it were a thing no where commanded.

For as when he commands a thing about the Service of God, it becomes unlawful to be done: So when he forbids any thing, it becomes unlawful to let it alone; your Liberty being invaded by him either way. If he would but require therefore that no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhould wear the Surplice, or uſe the Sign of the Croſs; we ſhould ſee all your Miniſters with Surplices on their Backs, and all your Children croſſed in the Fore-head: For elſe

               <p>I have not much hope of it, If you feell not the force of theſe arguments: Yet I'll try what a familiar Reſemblance will do. We are agreed that the thing commanded by Authority, is not leſs indifferent in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture after it's commanded than it was before; but onely our uſe of it is not ſo indifferent and at liberty. We muſt needs be therefore agreed alſo that this Reſtraint comes not upon us from the things themſelves, becauſe ſtill perfectly indifferent; but onely from the Law, which ties us up: Now we ſay, that to this Law we are to be ſubject, not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own Liberty ſo much as the Prince's Authority. You ſay, No. But as the Law can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alter the Nature of the things, ſo it ought not to Reſtrain your Freedom in the uſe of them; but leave that as indifferent as the things themſelves. That is, that the King ought to make no ſuch Law about thoſe matters: If he do, then it is unlawfull to do what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to be always done; becauſe he ought to leave you at Liberty to let it alone if you pleaſe, and you ought to maintain your Liberty, and by no means to part with it. Put the caſe then that you (being Maſter of a Family) will have
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:110369:61"/>your Children and Servants to come at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time and place, &amp;c. to worſhip God. It is indifferent indeed in it ſelf, and all one to God, whether it be at ten, eleven, or twelve a clock, or in what part of your Houſe they meet, or in what Cloaths they come, or what Poſtures they uſe: But you appoint the hour of meeting ſhall be twelve; and that they come into your Parlour, or Hall, or Chappel, if you have that conveniency: And beſide, you require your Servants that they ſhall not come into your Parlour (ſuppoſe) in thoſe Frocks wherein they juſt before rubb'd your Horſe's Heels, (which you think not handſom or decent) but in their Liveries, or ſome ſuch neater Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel. And when they come there, you bid them ſtand ſome part of the time, and the reſt you bid them ſit, if they pleaſe, and at Prayers kneel, as you do your ſelf. Let me ask you now, Do you really think that this is any ſuch Reſtraint of their Liberty, as they have juſt cauſe to complain of it? Would you think you took too much upon you in making theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for your Family, of which you are Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? Or would you judge that Servant to be without fault, and guiltleſs of any Contempt, who ſhould ſay, that he will come at ten of the clock, but not at twelve; becauſe it matters not which, ſo the thing be done; and he will not be tied to any Order, but to do the thing? And ſuppoſe another ſhould come and ſay, that <pb n="108" facs="tcp:110369:62"/>he will pray, if you pleaſe to come into the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but he will not come into the Parlour; for it is indifferent where it is; and he muſt not be confined to one place more than another. And a third ſhould come and tell you that he is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to joyn in Prayer, but then it muſt be in his Frock, otherwiſe he will not; for God may be ſerved as well in that as any other Garment, and he muſt uſe his Chriſtian Liberty, and not be bound to your Faſhions. And the next ſhould tell you, that he will ſit in your preſence, or elſe you ſhall not have his company: His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe it is all one to God whether he ſit or ſtand; and he is not to let you be Maſter of his Freedom in thoſe matters. What would you ſay to theſe people? Nay, what would you do with them? Would you excuſe them, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge your own guilt in making ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions? Or would you not rather treat them as a company of ſaucy Clowns and ill-bred Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, not fit to be kept in any orderly family? If you ſhould not, all the world would hold you as ridiculous as they. For every Maſter of a family is veſted with ſufficient authority to ſee ſuch commands as thoſe obſerved. And when they that will not obſerve them, yet acknowledge them to be indifferent things; truly I think no body will think them harſhly uſed, if they be turned out of doors. If they be Fools and Blocks, that cannot underſtand common ſenſe; then (I confeſs) they are to be pitied; and his <pb n="109" facs="tcp:110369:62"/>good nature may work ſo far as to bear with their ſimplicity, if they be otherways good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: But yet thoſe Knaves that abuſed their ſimplicity, and inſtilled theſe filthy Principles into them; deſerve to be puniſh'd, and put out of his Service, till they acknowledge their fault, and learn more manners. Juſt like this is the preſent caſe before us. The Church is but a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Family, a wider Society, in which the King is the Father and Supreme Governour. If he make ſome Laws for the more convenient, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and decent Worſhip of God there, which in themſelves are Lawful, and declared not to be in their own nature neceſſary, but onely pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Conſtitutions; I cannot ſee but that thoſe who refuſe to obey them upon pretence of their Liberty, and that God may as well be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipp'd without thoſe things, do ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as unmannerly, rude, and refractory per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as the Children or Servants in that ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Family, of which I bad you conceive your ſelf Maſter. And I leave you to apply this caſe to that; and to make the parallel complete in your thoughts at your leiſure. I hope it will be worth your labour, if you do it ſeriouſly.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, do you make what Conſequences you think ſit from it. As for the thing it ſelf, I will maintain, that thoſe Miniſters you hear (ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed think otherwiſe) are not of the mind, that it is unlawful to come to Common Prayer, or wear a Surplice, or kneel at the Sacrament.</p>

               <p>Why, Man? I have ſeen them at the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and many of them have profeſſed they did not think the Ceremonies ſuch great Bugbears that one need to be afraid of them. And if this will not do, I have a more convincing Argument of their Opinion in theſe matters.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N.C.</speaker>
               <p>And do theſe very men now ſeem to diſlike the publick Prayers?</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Seem? you confeſs they ſpeak againſt Forms. And we ſee the open affronts they put upon our Service, by meeting at that very time when it is performed: the reaſon of which I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to you before.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N.C.</speaker>
               <p>Therefore I always thought they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it unlawful.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>No ſuch matter. You ſhould rather think ſomething elſe; and (to help you a little) conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether their Integrity be ſo great as you imagine.</p>

               <speaker>N.C.</speaker>
               <p>Your meaning, Sir?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I mean, they do not ſeem to me to deal ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely with you, in ſuffering you to live in this dangerous perſwaſion of the ſinfulneſs of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer and the Ceremonies; when they know in their Conſciences they are not ſinful. And then to hear you call it
<hi>Bibble-babble, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge,</hi> or ſuch like vile names, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, is ſtill worſe. But if you hear <hi>themſelves</hi> ſpeak againſt the Common Prayer and the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; there is the greater reaſon to have a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement ſuſpicion of their Diſhoneſty; becauſe they decry that which in their Conſciences they allow.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N.C.</speaker>
               <p>I am not fully ſatisfied of that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Why did many of them deliberate ſo long whether they ſhould accept of Dignities in the Church, if they did not believe it lawful to hear the Prayers, and to put even the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as you will needs call the Surplice) upon their backs; and more than that, to wear the very Rags of the Whore, the Lawn ſleeves? If it was ſo plain a buſineſs, that their Conſcience and their Covenant would not let them conform, one would think they ſhould have profeſſed it openly without any more ado. And therefore I conclude, that Pauſe and Deliberation was about ſomething elſe; not about matters of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but of Intereſt and Policy. As, Whether the people would take it well, and not laught at them, as ſo many Magpies got upon a Perch: <pb n="112" facs="tcp:110369:64"/>whether it would not be a ſcandalous thing, that is, not for their Credit and Reputation: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they could not hold ſuch a Party with them in Non-conformity, as would balance the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, and ſo force them at leaſt to a Toleration. In ſhort, whether they ſhould not loſe the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their own party, which they had already made; and win very little upon the Affections of others, whom they had ſo much diſobliged in the late Troubles. Theſe were their ſecret De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates in their Cabals, the weighty Points that were to be ſtated in thoſe Conſultations. You, Good man, think perhaps that they ſpent their time in Faſting and Seeking God to direct their Conſciences. No, no; it was not their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but their Credit, which then lay at ſtake.—</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Becauſe I have heard ſome of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge they did not ſcruple what we do, but thought it unhandſom for <hi>them</hi> to do it. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they put it in a more Religious phraſe, and ſaid, it would give a great ſcandal to the world, who would think the worſe of the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity. But the meaning was in plain
<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> that they were aſhamed to confeſs their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and to ſet up thoſe things again which they had raſhly pulled down.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, but not ſo much as the peace of the <pb n="113" facs="tcp:110369:64"/>Church of God. We ought to deny our ſelves, and be content to be put to ſhame for God's ſake; (which is indeed true Glory) and there is little of God among them that ſeek not Peace, though on thoſe terms. Beſides, there can no account be given of their Behavior ſince in cheriſhing this Fancy among you, (or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to grow) that Conformity is unlawful, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be this that they think it will make more for their Reputation among you, if you believe it was Conſcience, not care of their own Credit &amp; Eſtimation, that kept them from Conforming</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I will not cenſure them of that, but this I can tell you, that one of your Miniſters confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to a ſober perſon of my acquaintance, that he had never ſo much as read over the <pb n="114" facs="tcp:110369:65"/>Common-Prayer-book in all his life; and yet he was no Youngſter. Perhaps there may be more ſuch: and then if they ſpeak againſt it, judge of them as you ſee Cauſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I believe ſuch men diſlike it without looking into it; becauſe, as I told you, it is <hi>Will-Worſhip,</hi> a meer invention of man.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>That's a word of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> whom no doubt they have read; but I queſtion whether they underſtood him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I do not ſay ſo; but I have heard one of our Miniſters give ſuch an Explication of the place as ſatisfied me, that you uſe a Weapon which wounds your ſelves.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Let's hear it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>If you look a little back, you will find the Apoſtle forbids
<hi>Worſhipping of Angels;</hi> (<hi>v.</hi> 18.) as a bold invention of men, for which there was no Revelation. And then he ſpeaks againſt ſuch ſuperſtitious people (whether <hi>Jews,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the miniſter could not tell us) as made it unlawful to Marry, to eat ſome kind of Meats, to touch or come near ſome things; none of which God hath made ſinful, but they were the meer Commandments of men, (<hi>v.</hi> 21.22.)
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:110369:65"/>Now thoſe that were of this Humour he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after (<hi>v.</hi> 23.) charges with <hi>Will-Worſhip.</hi> Which muſt conſiſt, therefore, one would think, in theſe two things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> In giving the Worſhip due to God to ſome Creature or other. <hi>Secondly,</hi> in enjoyning that as a thing neceſſary, and commanded by God as a piece of his VVorſhip and Service, which he hath left indifferent; or, in other words, when any thing is ſo enjoyned to be done or not done, as if it were the Will &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God he ſhould be ſo ſerved, when it is a meer Conſtitution of the Will of Man, then a <hi>Will-Worſhip</hi> is erected. Now I am ſure you will not make us guilty of the <hi>Firſt</hi> fort of Will-Worſhip, becauſe none are more againſt it than we. As for the <hi>Second;</hi> our Church hath declared to all the World, that none of the things you boggle at are impoſed under the Notion of Neceſſary, or Religious, in themſelves, or as commanded by God; but are of an indifferent Nature, and only uſed as decent and comely in the judgment of the preſent Governors, who can alter theſe things, and conſtitute ſomething elſe in the room, if they ſee it fit; which they could not pretend to, did they think them neceſſary. But then, as our Church is not guilty of <hi>Will-Worſhip</hi> in the Apoſtles Senſe; ſo, on the other ſide, I know not how to excuſe thoſe from that very guilt, who oppoſe what is ordained among us as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:110369:66"/>and forbid us to uſe thoſe Rites and Orders, becauſe ſinful things. For they make that neceſſary to be forborn and left undone, which God hath not made ſo, but left indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; and ſo they in effect condemn thoſe as Sinners whom God acquits from all blame. As thoſe in the Apoſtle's Diſcourſe, ſaid, <hi>Touch not, Taſte not, Handle not,</hi> ſo you ſay, <hi>Kneel not, Pray not by a Form, We are not a Surplice,</hi> &amp;c. Now ſince you think (as thoſe men did) to pleaſe God by not doing thoſe things which he hath no-where forbidden; I do not ſee but you commit the very fault which the Apoſtle reproves: That is, you make that neceſſary not to be done, (if we will be true Worſhippers of God) which he hath not made neceſſary not to be done, but left us at liberty to do it if we pleaſe. By which means <hi>you make a Religion of your own,</hi> and ſtudy to honour God by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from theſe things by which he never ſaid that he was diſhonoured. O that all ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſciences would ſeriouſly conſider this. For they would ſoon diſcern that your Miniſters by forbidding theſe things now in diſpute, lay greater burthens upon the Conſciences of their Brethren, and clog them with more Duties, than God hath laid upon them. Whereas we, who think thoſe things may be done, lay no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther burthen upon the Conſcience than what God himſelf hath laid; which is, to obey our Governors in all things wherein he himſelf <pb n="117" facs="tcp:110369:66"/>hath not bidden us to do the contrary.</p>

Which Dread ſprings (as you very well ſaw) out of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that ſuch things are good or evil, (and ſo muſt be done or muſt not be done, elſe God will take it ill) which in truth are meerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.

For you think you muſt not, for fear of God's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, uſe a Form, nor ſign a Child with the Croſs in Baptiſm, nor Bow in the Houſe of God, nor go up to the Rails, nay, nor Kneel, nor hear Church Muſick, nor uncover your Heads when you enter into a Church, nor call the Lord's-day
<hi>Sunday,</hi> nor keep an Holy-day. Nay, it was a long time before you thought it lawful to let your Hair grow below your Ears. All which things we may do, and not diſpleaſe God at all. On the other ſide. You imagine you are bound to propagate &amp; ſpread all your little Opinions, though with the Ruin of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms: That you are tied to maintain your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in indifferent matters, againſt all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a King, and to the diſturbing a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:110369:67"/>Church: That you have a Sermon or two on a Faſting day, or elſe you fear it is not kept; and two Sermons on the Lord's-day, or elſe you doubt it is not Sanctified. Nay, ſome of you (I remember) fanſied heretofore, that it was no Sermon, if it were not in the Pulpit. And to ſuch an height is your Superſtition grown, that you ſcarce think a Prayer is acceptable to God, unleſs it be long. And you are afraid he is not ſerved aright, unleſs we have a long Prayer before Sermon, after we have been pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great while for all manner of things. And ſuch a Neceſſity you ſeem to lay upon extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Prayer, that many well-diſpoſed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who have not that Gift, dare not pray at all, (at leaſt in their Families) for fear they ſhould not pray aright. And all theſe are things of ſuch a nature, as that they may not be done, or done otherwiſe than you think they muſt, and God be never the leſs pleaſed with us.</p>

               <p>If I ſhould do ſo, I ſhould ſpeak againſt my ſelf, and ran into your fault, I think they may be uſed, or they may be let alone, according as the Edification of the People ſhall require. But to make them ſo neceſſary as you do, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from a <hi>Superſtitious</hi> Fanſie, that God is not well ſerved without them. Whereas in
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:110369:68"/>truth the Catechiſm expounded, or the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures opened, would be as well, or rather better.</p>

               <p>You ſhould rather ſuſpect there are naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty things at the bottom of ſuch Opinions as yours. For the Fruit of your Superſtition is this at the beſt; Raſh and unjuſt Cenſuring of your Brethren, that do not the things which you make ſo neceſſary to be done, or do the things which you make ſo neceſſary to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born; and at laſt downright Schiſm and Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from them, becauſe you fanſie they are out of the way of God.</p>

               <p>I muſt confeſs I have ſome fear you are ſo; who can be content without a Sermon in the Afternoon, and ſatisfied with Common-Prayer; which I could never feel my ſelf ſo affected with, as I am with extemporary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>That's becauſe you had ſo low an eſteem of it, and therefore brought no deſires, nor uſed any Endeavours to be moved by it: but rather you ſet your ſelf in a dull and ſleepy Poſture, as one that had no liſt to hear it. I could tell you ſomething elſe beſides this, but it would only vex you.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I believe if you would examine your ſelf, <pb n="121" facs="tcp:110369:68"/>you would find there is <hi>ſome part</hi> of your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters extemporary Prayers, which do no more affect you than our Service.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>The Entrance or Beginning of his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: When he ſpeaks very ſlow, as if he was ſtudying what to ſay, and draws out his words with a low Voice, and with a ſmall degree of Vehemence, and little or no Motion; then I ſay, I believe your Affections are low too, and you feel not your heart much moved. But when his Voice begins to riſe, (eſpecially, if he lift it up on a ſudden, and it break out like a Clap of Thunder) and when he ſpeaks more fluently, &amp; his Zeal begins to kindle, and he lays about him, and is full of life (as you call it) that is, uſes a great deal of Action; then is the time, if the truth were known; that your Affections ſtir, and begin to riſe from the bottom of your Heart, where they lay heavy and dull before. Then you ſigh and groan, and perhaps weep, and are put into many Paſſions, which lay quiet enough till his Breath blew lowder. Is not this the plain truth?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Then you are no more affected with the Prayers of your Miniſter, (as they are pious Petitions or Acknowledgments of God) than you are with our Common-Prayer; But only with the Voice, the Vehemency, the Action, the pretty Fancies and fine Phraſes, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <pb n="122" facs="tcp:110369:69"/>he lights upon when he is a little heated; which were it my caſe, 'twould make me ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Love of God was not in me. For why ſhould he think he loves God, who is not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with Affection to him when he hears his Greatneſs, Goodneſs, Wiſdom, and Benefits to us, ſoberly and gravely expreſſed, but is in a great Commotion when he meets with a new Word that pleaſes him, or a kind Phraſe, or melting Tone, a ſweet Voice, or ſome ſuch thing?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>If it be, then pray tell me, why ſhould not the Common-Prayer affect you, whoſe ſenſe is good enough, only it is not varied and dreſſed up in new words every day? I beſeech you try your Heart, by examining the Book, &amp; conſidering whether thoſe very things be not requeſted of God there, which you deſire in your Prayers: and if they be, then demand of your ſelf a Reaſon why they move you no more. I doubt you will find it is becauſe they are not new, but old Expreſſions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>To help you a little take this along with you; which will go near to convince you, that if it be not the Voice and Tone, it is the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty which affects you. Suppoſe one of the Prayers of your own Miniſters, which you think is indicted by the Spirit, was taken in ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:110369:69"/>writing, and afterward uſed every day in the Service of God, as often as our Prayers are: Tell me ſeriouſly, do you not think it would ſeem very flat at laſt, fuller of nauceous Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and faulty Expreſſions than you conceive to be in the Common-Prayer?</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I ſee you are inclined to be of my mind; and therefore pray conſider theſe two things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That ſince even a Prayer which you think ſo heavenly would not affect you alway, if it were alway uſed; it is to be feared you are moved only while Prayers are new, and indeed becauſe they are new, not becauſe they are good &amp; pious Petitions. And
<hi>Secondly,</hi> that ſince it is convenient, if not neceſſary, to have a Form of Prayer in the Church, and the Common-Prayer hath no other Imperfection but what thoſe whom you ſo much admire would have, were they conſtantly uſed, as it is; why ſhould you not like it as well as any, eſpecially ſince it is eſtabliſhed by publick Authority?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I will conſider of it, as I ſaid before. But I wiſh you had ſeen a Book (as I perceive you have many of ours) newly come out, which ſuppoſes <hi>your Service-Book hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed to Superſtition and Idolatry,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be aboliſh'd.</p>

            <sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>You ſeem to be in a moſt dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for you are infected, as I told you, already with the extravagant Fancies of a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other Sects, with whom you are blen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And in all likelihood you will have ſuch new Inventions, or rather Frenzies, every year, as will at laſt deſtroy your ſelves as well as us. Some of your Miniſters, for inſtance, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that the Liturgy is lawful to be uſed, and can read it themſelves. Others there are that think it lawful, but not convenient for men of their Parts and Gifts, whoſe Miniſtry (which it ſeems is of great Neceſſity &amp; Benefit) they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive would be thereby rendred leſs uſeful. Then there is a third ſort who are gone farther and doubt of its Lawfulneſs: So that they dare not be preſent at it, though they are content o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould, who think it lawful. And now here is a man thinks no body ought to hear it, nor be ſuffered to uſe ſuch a Form of Worſhip; but though the Magiſtrate ought to tolerate you, yet he ought not to tolerate us. For he ſaith, It is his Duty utterly to extirpate the Liturgy, as well as the Ceremonies. And every <hi>one of you in your places ought to do your parts towards the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhing <pb n="125" facs="tcp:110369:70"/>of it; and not ſit ſtill in the midſt of ſuch Defilements and Snares, but diſcover your hatred of them, decline their uſe, and in ſuch ways as Prudence, Juſtice and Order do allow, Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the rooting of them out.</hi> Whether you will go next, God only knows. And God help the poor Children of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> who when all ſo boldly challenge Liberty and Toleration, muſt be the only Perſons excluded from this Favour, and, according to this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, be denied the uſe of the Common-Prayer, when every body elſe may pray what he liſt.</p>

               <p>You muſt be content, if he have <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced</hi> (as he tells us he hath, in his Title page) <hi>That the Liturgy, Ceremonies, and other things uſed at this day in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>ought neither to be impoſed, nor retained, but utterly extirpated and laid aſide.</hi> And he pretends in his Epiſtle to have ſaid more in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than ever was ſaid before.</p>

               <p>He doth ſo, and imagins he can weild an old rotten Engine, that hath been long laid aſide, better than former Workmen, who were but Bunglers in compare with this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt.

               <p>It is this Principle, <hi>That it is the will and pleaſure of God, that ſuch things as have been <pb n="126" facs="tcp:110369:71"/>abuſed and polluted in Superſtitions and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Services ſhould be aboliſhed and laid aſide</hi> (pag. 15.)

               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>And what have you to ſay to it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I will firſt tell you what he ſays to it, After he had told us a great many things (which every body knows) concerning the will of God that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould aboliſh the Images &amp; Groves and Altars of the <hi>Cananites,</hi> &amp;c. and thence concluded, that <hi>ſuch things</hi> as have been imployed to corrupt ends and purpoſes muſt be aboliſhed: at laſt he comes and tells us, that this principle muſt not be extended too far, nor made to ſerve againſt <hi>all things</hi> that have been ſo abuſed, and he excepts a great number. Nothing Commanded by God muſt be diſuſed upon this account; none of Gods Creatures are to be refuſed; nay, no neceſſary and profitable Devices of men need be ſent packing, though they have been ſo profan'd, &amp; more than this, he ſays that things which are but in a competent degree uſeful, may be retain'd, if they have been abuſed to Idolatry only in a ſlight manner; that is, a little while. Nay, things that have been more groſly abuſed, in caſe there be no danger for the future of their being imploy'd, to Idolatry, he is content ſhould be ſpar'd, and uſed either to Civil or Religious purpoſes. <pb n="127" facs="tcp:110369:71"/>Now let any man, that can be Maſter of cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Thoughts but for one minute, tell me, if this be not as much as to ſay his Principle is not true; and that things are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected merely upon this account, that they have been imployed in falſe Worſhip, but there muſt be ſome other reaſon for it. For if there be ſo many things, as he confeſſes, that may be abuſed; and yet may, nay ſome ought to be ſtill uſed in God's Service, then the Abuſe is not a ſufficient reaſon for our throwing them away utterly, but there muſt be ſome other which makes it neceſſary. And if he had told us that reaſon plainly, and ſpent his Diſcourſe in making it good; he had done like a man. But he ſaw (it's like) that this would not have done his buſineſs, for it would not for inſtance, have reached to the taking away of Common-Prayer; becauſe it may be ſtill <hi>uſeful,</hi> as much (ſure) as his <hi>Pen, which,</hi> he tells us, <hi>muſt not be thrown away, if any man be ſo fooliſh as to bow down to it and worſhip it.</hi> (pag. 130.) And as
<hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> I ſhould think, as the <hi>Water-Pots</hi> in
<hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> which he confeſſes our Saviour uſed,
<hi>though abuſed to Superſtition and unlawful Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications,</hi> And it is in no danger to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd to Idolatry, for the Papiſts hate it; and I hope he hath no thoughts that we ever intend to ſay theſe Prayers to Saints or Angels, any more than <hi>to bow to a Saint or Angel ſtanding for a Sign at an Inn-keeper's door:</hi> And yet <pb n="128" facs="tcp:110369:72"/>that is no ſuch Profanation of the Sign in his judgment, but that the owner may let it ſtand, unleſs it become cuſtomary to bow to it.</p>

               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Well. Is not the Gentleman to be commended for his Honeſty, in not concealing this from his Readers, that his Propoſition or Doctrine is not to be underſtood univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>He durſt do no otherwiſe. For if <hi>by things abuſed which muſt be aboliſhed,</hi> he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>all things abuſed,</hi> then he ſaw the <hi>Lord's-day</hi> would be antiquated, the
<hi>Sacrament of the Lord</hi>'s Supper laid aſide, nay, <hi>he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> put out of his Miniſtry: the Chriſtian Prieſts or Miniſters having ſo much ſerved Idols as he ſuppoſes. But ſince his Doctrine was to be limited, why was he not ſo honeſt as to do it at firſt; that ſo no Reader might be abuſed, who perhaps would not go ſo far as to come to his Limitations? Why did he not ſay, <hi>ſome things abuſed</hi> muſt be lay'd aſide, and in ſome Caſe; for that's the ſenſe of his Propoſition? To make it plainer what I mean, I ſay, (mark it I pray you) by <hi>things abuſed,</hi> he underſtands only <hi>ſome things;</hi> and when he ſays they <hi>muſt be lay'd aſide,</hi> he means
<hi>in ſome Caſes</hi> they muſt be lay'd aſide; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by his Exceptions afterwards. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had done ſincerely, if he had drawn up his Propoſition thus, (and it had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his Text, 2
<hi>Kings</hi> 18.4.) <hi>Some <pb n="129" facs="tcp:110369:72"/>things abuſed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are in ſome caſes to be lay'd aſide.</hi> But, I conceive he ſaw that this would not ſo well ſerve his purpoſe; which was, to put people out of conceit with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer and Ceremonies as much as ever he could. For the Doctrine would not have been ſo popular, nor ſo eaſie to declaim up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It would have put him to a great deal of pains, to
<hi>ſpecifie the things</hi> that muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be deſtroy'd, and then he muſt have undertaken an harder Task, <hi>to name the Caſes</hi> wherein thoſe things, that might otherwiſe be ſpared, muſt needs be aboliſh'd; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother harder than that, to ſhew that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome particular things were aboliſh'd at one time, none of the like kind muſt ever be uſed. And then he muſt have proceeded to ſhew, which ought to have made the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of his Book, but now in a manner is taken for granted) that the Liturgy is in the number of thoſe things that have been ſo abuſed; and that the caſe is ſo, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be tolerated, but muſt be deſtroyed by the <hi>King,</hi> as the Brazen Serpent was by
<hi>Hezekiah.</hi> Which would have proved the moſt difficult labour of all. For ſuppoſing it had been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver imploy'd to Idolatry, (which can never be proved;) yet ſince <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood, would never have deſtroy'd ſuch a Monument of God's mercies as the Brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, had the people of a long time ceaſed <pb n="130" facs="tcp:110369:73"/>to burn Incenſe to it, and been in no danger to do ſo again; why ſhould we throw away the Liturgy, now that it is not abuſed to any Idolatrous purpoſe, nor in any likelihood ſo to be? Beſides, it cannot be ſo aboliſh'd as the Brazen Serpent was, but the very ſame Form may be brought forth again upon occaſion. And therefore any likelihood that may be fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of its being uſed to Idolatry in future times can be of no conſideration here, becauſe it may be ſo uſed whether we lay it aſide or no.</p>
               <p>All theſe things conſidered, he very wiſely waved this Method; and only tells the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <hi>general</hi> terms that
<hi>things</hi> abuſed in falſe Worſhip muſt be laid aſide: Under which he knew the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by them, without any more adoe. For though his Inſtances or Proofs be all
<hi>particular,</hi> and therefore he ſaw well enough his Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought to have been ſo; yet the people he knew might not ſee it, but preſently conclude the <hi>Liturgy</hi> muſt be packt away among the things abuſed. And though he makes limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and reſtrictions of this Propoſition, to ſhew it is not Univerſal; yet they come a great way behind. And before there is any certainty what the <hi>abuſed things</hi> are, which muſt be laid aſide; the Magiſtrate is told his Duty, and earneſtly preſſed to remove them: the people alſo are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in theirs; who, he ſaith, are all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned <pb n="131" facs="tcp:110369:73"/>in one reſpect or other, as you may ſee <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. Then he ſpends another Section to ſhew the manner how it muſt be done; and another about the
<hi>time;</hi> declaring, they muſt <hi>forthwith lay their hand to the work,</hi> even before they knew what they had to do, (for the time was not come to tell them that.) And then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other follows, to give the
<hi>Reaſons</hi> of the Point: wherein <hi>theſe things</hi> are Repreſented as ſo odious and loathſom to God, that you may well think the
<hi>Liturgy</hi> might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the Flames by the Reader, before he came to conſider whether it was not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted thing; and he might be in ſuch a flame to ſee execution done <hi>forthwith;</hi> as not to have patience to deliberate whether he ought to ſave it or no. Nor is the matter much men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded when he comes to his Cautions: for, leſt it ſhould happen to be acquitted or reprieved, he doth not ſo much as bring it to a trial, much leſs bid his Readers take heed of paſſing raſh judgment, without examining whether it were guilty of the aforeſaid Crime or no; but fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leaves it to take its chance, and to ſtand or fall in their opinion as it ſhould happen. And therefore he did wiſely intimate in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that Section, that it muſt be left to the Reader to compare his Cautions with what he had ſaid; for there is not one in twenty that will take that pains, and fewer that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do it to any purpoſe, without ſome
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:110369:74"/>aſſiſtance. In ſhort, as far as I can judge, (for God only knows the Heart) he ſaw it was his beſt way to let his Reſtrictions alone till the laſt, and to propound his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in round and general words, becauſe he knew the people would more readily ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it; whereas if it had been broken into parts, ſome of which were to be taken, and ſome left; they might prove more nice, when they ſaw there was a ſcrupulous difference to be made. But that we may ſee what force there is in his Principle to do ſuch feats as he imagins, I pray, if you can, reſolve me one thing.</p>

Now ſhew me how any Popiſh Prieſt, who in his language is a thing abuſed (ſo notoriouſly) in Superſtitious and Idolatrous Worſhip, may ever be made uſe of more in the Service of God eſpecially when you conſider what a poſſibility there is, that he may be Serviceable
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:110369:74"/>in the falſe Worſhip again. For my part, I think, according to his Principles, that he ought not only to be laid aſide, but to be kill'd.</p>

<hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> or the <hi>Apoſtate Iſraelites</hi> and the <hi>Prieſts of Baal;</hi> and leaves you to be ſo kind as to ſuppoſe, (though he go not about to prove it) that God hath decreed the like againſt all Idolaters whatſoever. And then at laſt he thus concludes; <hi>How far this concerns the Papiſts, the knowledg of their ways and practice will inform us. That they are Idolaters the beſt Proteſtant writers affirm. And it will not relieve them to alledg that they worſhip the true God; for ſo did the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>when they worſhipped the Calf, yet no body queſtions but they were guilty of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> I wonder he did not adde, from what went before, <hi>and you very well know</hi> Moſes <hi>ordere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I muſt confeſs his Diſcourſe ought to have ended ſo, if it be as you relate. And as I do not like it upon that account, ſo there's another thing that makes me think he is out of the way. There are many that ſcruple to call the place of your Aſſemblies a <hi>Church,</hi> and yet they would not have them pull'd down, (as they muſt be by theſe Principles) they being convenient Places to meet in for the Service of God. And for my part I would have the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrals ſtand, if it were but to be an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Nation; though I plainly ſee his Engine, as you call it, will throw them all down, if we ſuffer it to go to work.</p>

               <p>He ſaw this as well as you; and therein could not but diſcern his Principle was bad, becauſe it prov'd more than he would have it. And therefore perceiving how it undermin'd the Foundation of all our Churches, (except ſome few lately built) and being loth ſuch goodly Fabricks ſhould tumble down, nay all the ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt Buildings in
<hi>Europe</hi> be laid in the <hi>duſt;</hi> he, in great compaſſion quits his Principle, that he might ſupport them. For he tells you, that thoſe only are to be thrown down which in reſpect of their <hi>Situation and Figure or the like, are unfit for profitable <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes; and ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main deck'd with their Idols Attire; and ſtand among ſuch people as are ſcandaliz'd with the uſe of them, and are in ſuch places where there is danger of their return to Idolatry;</hi> which a man half blind ſees is as much as to ſay, They are not to be laid aſide becauſe they have been imploy'd to Idolatry, but for other conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He himſelf confeſſes as much, when he ſaith, <hi>if they be in regard of their Situation and Figure, and the like; ſit for profitables <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they may lawfully be retain'd.</hi> That is, as if he had ſaid, there is no neceſſity of laying them aſide, becauſe they were abuſed in falſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and therefore my Principle is not true which I laid down at the beginning, <hi>that things abuſed in falſe worſhip muſt be aboliſhed.</hi> Are you not amazed that he ſhould be thus forced to forſake his Principle, and yet not mend it? <pb n="136" facs="tcp:110369:76"/>Nay, as if he would demonſtrate that men are carried by Humour and Prejudice when they talk of theſe matters, after all this, he would have <hi>Cathedrals</hi> pull'd down, as the <hi>High places</hi> were.</p>

               <p>For any thing I can ſee there is none, but they have all the qualifications he mentioned to deſerve his Favour. Neither the Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nor their Figure hinders but they may be fit for profitable Uſes. I never ſaw any Idols attire with which they are adorn'd; nor do they ſtand among thoſe who are ſcandaliz'd at them, unleſs it be ſuch as himſelf, (and ſome other humourſome people) who firſt take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at them without any reaſon, and then make this ſerve for a Reaſon why they ſhould be pull'd down.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>If he have, he concealed it, or it muſt ly in their Figure and Situation rendring them unfit for profitable Uſes, or in their remaining deck'd with their Idols Attire; from none of which can there be any thing alledged more againſt the Cothedrals than againſt other Churches; nor ſo much neither, in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards. For they may be made to ſerve many more profitable uſes than a ſmall Church. But if his people's being offended at them, no body knows why, nor wherefore, muſt ſtand alone for a Reaſon; then mark unto what a fine paſs <pb n="137" facs="tcp:110369:76"/>he hath brought his buſineſs.

<hi>Quakers</hi> and many other people are extremely offended at them, and could be content with a <hi>Gothiſh</hi> Barbariſm to demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them. Or if they were not, we know not when the Conceit will take men to be ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliz'd; and then they muſt be converted into Stables or Cow-houſes, or what they pleaſe; or rather pull'd down, for fear they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to Churches again.

               <p>Upon a Petition of the Aſſembly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, <hi>July</hi>
19. there was an Ordinance (I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) of 28. <hi>Aug.</hi> 1643. requiring that <hi>all Monuments of Superſtition and Idolatry ſhould be demoliſh'd;</hi> which was repeated again, to make ſure work, <hi>May</hi>
9. 1644. Now why Churches were not mention'd is hard to tell, for they were dedicated to the honour of ſome <pb n="138" facs="tcp:110369:77"/>Saint or other at the firſt: and to thoſe Saints there was then ſuch an Abhorrence, that as they would not let their Images or Pictures ſtand, ſo, it ſhould ſeem, their Coats of Arms, if they had any, were to be defaced. For thus a Proviſo at the latter end runs: <hi>This Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſhall not extend to the taking down the Image, or Picture, or Coat of Arms, ſet up for any dead man, who was not commonly reputed a Saint.</hi> It ſeems they concluded, that none of the reputed Saints in their days would be thought ſo hereafter, (for then no Picture or Image at all ſhould have been allow'd, for fear of being worſhipped) and their words ſuppoſe, that any of thoſe (either Image, Picture, or Coat of Arms) belonging to any ancient repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Saints muſt not ſtand. The Churches there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that bore their Names, and were better
<hi>Monuments</hi> and remembrances of them than any Coat of Arms, had good fortune they were not beaten down.</p>

               <p>It is like, ſome had no mind to take any notice of them, but were rather well pleaſed to paſs them by.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Perhaps ſo: For men can paſs things by, <pb n="139" facs="tcp:110369:77"/>or take but little notice of them, when they liſt; though they concern them very much: Of which we have an inſtance in this very Writer. For being to treat of things abuſed, firſt he tells us of <hi>Perſons,</hi> then of <hi>Names,</hi> next of <hi>Times,</hi> and after that of
<hi>Places</hi> which have been imploy'd to Superſtitious or Idolatrous Uſes. And of each of theſe he diſcourſes in a ſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by it ſelf. Would not any man have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected now to find one Section on purpoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Books</hi> that have been ſo abuſed? Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince his greateſt Spite is at the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and it is the prime thing he undertook to overthrow? And yet he thruſts this thing into a Corner, as ſome did their Glaſs-windows heretofore, not being deſirous to meddle much with it, nor having much to ſay in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I mean, he crouds it in among many other things, at the end of that Section about <hi>abuſed Places;</hi> and there you find it under the Name of ſuch <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tenſils</hi> as have been devoted to Superſtitious Uſes, which are <hi>Altars, Images, Books, Reliques, Veſſels and other Inſtruments that have been imployed in that manner.</hi> Now mark, I pray you, in what general terms he ſpeaks of all theſe together, (for you muſt not expect to have them diſtinctly handled:) <hi>Though in themſelves</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they are never ſo innocent, rich and ſplendid; yet when once they have been Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to ſuch Wickedneſs, He would have them caſt away, as things unfit to be retained by thoſe <pb n="140" facs="tcp:110369:78"/>that profeſs his Name.</hi> Would you look now to find any limitation of this, and to hear that things fit for God's Service may be retain'd? And yet in this very Section he allows this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to <hi>Places;</hi> and there is the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>Books</hi> ſhould enjoy it. And would you not expect a clear proof of this, that even Innocent things muſt be deſtroy'd, (and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Books imploy'd in Idol-worſhip?) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſince he pretends to juſtifie his Aſſertion by Scripture, and ſaith, <hi>This appears by divers expreſs Precepts which he gave the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>to this purpoſe?</hi>

               <p>Read but <hi>pag.</hi> 75. and try if you find a Syllable ſpoken to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> about <hi>Books,</hi> or about
<hi>innocent things</hi> either. I can ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what concerns their Altars, Images and Pictures. He tells you, indeed, that whole Cities in
<hi>Canaan</hi> and every thing in them were to be deſtroy'd. But he would not take notice, at the ſame time, that this was only comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded concerning that Countrey; and that there is no proof can be made, that there were any innocent <hi>Books</hi> there imploy'd in their Idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip. No, we conclude rather all were Superſtitious and Idolatrous in themſelves, and ſuch as could never be imployed in Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. It is true, at laſt he comes to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber us, that in the New Teſtament we read, <pb n="141" facs="tcp:110369:78"/>the Chriſtian Converts burnt their <hi>Curious Books, Act.</hi> 19.19. But what is this to the Precepts he promiſed to ſhew us given to the
<hi>Iſraelites?</hi> And what is this to the buſineſs of Prayer-Books? Nay, why did he not ſhew us the Innocence of theſe Books, and prove that Conjuring was a very harmleſs Art?—</p>

For what is this but to impoſe his belief upon us, as much as he is able, in <pb n="142" facs="tcp:110369:79"/>his place? Doth he only offer his Reaſons, who ſolicites and perſwades and intreats men to promote his Deſign?

This I make no doubt, was the thing that put him ſo much beſide the Cuſhion, as to make him magnifie the Purity of thoſe Doctrines, which in ſober thoughts he ſaw were of perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious conſequence. And I would willingly think it was nothing elſe that made him only paſs his word, that the Liturgy is one of the things that God would have laid aſide, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Proof of it: For whatſoever he or the Aſſembly have been pleaſed to ſay, no body ever <hi>made an Idol of it,</hi> or were guilty of <hi>ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it.</hi> Theſe are but a kind of Conjuring Phraſes and Magical words, which make a great Sound, and aſtoniſh the ſilly people, but ſignifie nothing, ſave only this, that men care not what they ſay to ſerve their cauſe. And therefore I hope you will not be afrighted by ſuch Bug-bears, but come and do your Duty to <pb n="143" facs="tcp:110369:79"/>God and man both together, in joyning with us in <hi>Common-Prayer.</hi>

               <p>I will conſider it as I have told you more than once: But I have had the leſs mind to come to it, becauſe after it is done, your Miniſter prays ſo coldly him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

               <p>Becauſe I am not dull in other places, and yet was ſo at your Church.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>You may be in the fault for all that. For perhaps you was diſaffected to his Perſon, or to his method of handling things; or you had a greater Kindneſs for ſome other; and then, though S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf ſhould preach, you would be apt to prefer that man before him.</p>

               <p>Why, what did you hear him treat of?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I heard him preach about the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Obedience to the Laws of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And there he told us how we muſt do as we would be done unto, and love our Neighbours as our ſelves, and forgive Injuries, and make Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of ill-gotten Goods; with a great many other ſuch like things, which every body knows already. And yet he ſpent I know not well how many Sermons about theſe common matters.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Does every body know theſe things, ſay you? The greater ſhame then that they live not according to them. I am afraid they are not ſenſible of the neceſſity of theſe things, about which a man of any underſtanding and ſeriouſneſs cannot well ſpeak, and be flat and dull. I much ſuſpect that you even ſet your ſelf to ſleep, or ſuffered your thoughts to run to other matter, or fell a reading in your Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, (as I have ſeen ſome do) when he begun to treat of ſuch Arguments as theſe, thinking that you was little concern'd in them.</p>

               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt confeſs part of what you ſay. For when I come to Church, I look not for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but Chriſtian Doctrines.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>How now? Do you oppoſe Morality and Chriſtianity? Is not the former a part of the latter? I mean; doth not the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion teach us the higheſt Morality?</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Then you talk of this as you do of many other things, without underſtanding. Pray what is Moral Doctrine?</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I always took it to be that Doctrine which teaches us how to regulate our manners, that is, to order and govern our actions, or our whole Behaviour in this World. Now I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to any man that reads the Goſpel, whether this be not the very deſign of it, to teach us to <hi>live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godlily.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Is this morality?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, that it is. And therefore I ſaid that Chriſtian Religion advances Morality to the greateſt height; becauſe it gives us the beſt and moſt excellent Motives to live ſoberly, righteouſly, charitably, and piouſly in this World.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>For all this, I think it were better if <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> were more preached.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Still I ſee you deceive your ſelf, and trouble the world with Phraſes. Doth not he preach <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> that preaches his Doctrine? If you doubt of it, you ſhall have Scripture enough to prove it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>But I mean that the Love of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to poor Souls ſhould be more preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot ſay it ſhould be more preached;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:110369:81"/>but it ought to be preached, and ſo it is; and perhaps better; than you would have it. For his Love is declared, to the end we may love him and keep his Commandments. This is that which the Grace of God teaches us, to live ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, &amp;c. The Loving-Kindneſs of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mankind, in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> was expreſſed for this very purpoſe. And therefore he that preaches both theſe together is the beſt and wiſeſt Guide with whom to entruſt our Souls; and that is the deſign of our Miniſter. He doth not tickle us merely with a ſoft Story of the great love of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> towards Sinners; But labours to beget in us an ardent love to him. And leſt we ſhould run away with a pleaſant Fanſie, he makes us underſtand where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this love conſiſts, <hi>Viz.</hi> in Obedience to him to the very death; in Meekneſs, Humility, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, taking up the Croſs, and ſuch like Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; which ſeem to be rough things, and have no amiableneſs in the eye of the World, but are as dear to all thoſe who love our Saviour, as their very Lives. And this makes me think him the moſt ſincere and honeſt, that he doth not ſeek ſo much to pleaſe us in his Preaching, as to profit us.</p>

               <p>Whoſe fault was that? Yours, or his? You are loth to ſuſpect your ſelf, and inclin'd to lay all the load on others. I believe it will be <pb n="147" facs="tcp:110369:81"/>found at the great Day that he hath done his duty better than you.</p>

               <p>That's a thing, which neither you nor I know. But this I am ſure of, that I can profit more by others, than by him.</p>

               <p>If you profit ſo much, then your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters make you

What things do you now under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Reaſon of better than formerly? Or what account can you give me of the grounds of Chriſtian Faith, and of the Hope that is in you? What Rules of Prudence have you met withal? What explication of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? I was going to ask what Point in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity you are able to ſtate with Judgement and due Caution? But that's too hard a Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>That is, you are grown <hi>better:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:110369:82"/>I beſeech you? Are your carnal Affections more mortified? Are your Paſſions more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued to Reaſon? Are you more humble and lowly in heart?

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>That's ſtrange, when you are neither wiſer nor better, as far as I can diſcern. One would think you ſhould ſuſpect them to be fooliſh and deceitful Comforts, becauſe they have ſo little ground, except it be in your Imagination.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes: But every body cannot fetch it.

By which you may ſee, if you will that we muſt feel ſomething that is good in our ſelves, (and more than good Deſires, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:110369:82"/>Affections and Purpoſes) before we can feel that ſolid Comfort and Satisfaction you ſpeak of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Then it ſeems we muſt fetch our comfort from our own ſelves.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>No. But it ſeems you are grown ſo wiſe, and taken up in ſuch high Notions, that you cannot underſtand common Senſe. Is there any other Comfort you dare give to an ungodly man beſides this, that he may by the Grace of our Lord be made better, and ſo received into his Favour?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I think not.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Then before you can take that full Comfort in him which you talk of, you muſt feel that you are truly changed and converted to a love of Godlineſs, and a Life according to thoſe good Affections. All the good, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that is in us, and all that we hope for, we derive from our Saviour
<hi>Chriſt:</hi> but till we become good, and be made like him, we do but put our ſelves into a Fool's Paradiſe, if we fanſie that we are in his Favour, and that he will carry us to Heaven. And on the contrary, when we are once made partakers of his bleſſed Nature and Spirit, how can we chooſe but be full of Joy, both in that Reſemblance we find in our ſelves to him, and much more in the hopes he hath given us, that he will perfect thoſe Beginings in eternal Life? But it is as plain, that though we cannot but rejoyce very <pb n="150" facs="tcp:110369:83"/>much in that which we feel in our ſelves, (the Likeneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and good Hopes) yet the Original of this Joy &amp; Satisfaction is not from our ſelves, but him, who gave us that Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of his nature and thoſe good Hopes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I do not well underſtand you. But this I know, that you all talk as if we were <hi>to bring ſomething to</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and not to take all from him.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Rather to talk thus is to be very ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. For he invites us to come to him, <hi>i.e.</hi> to believe on him, and become his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Followers. And this we muſt do, or elſe be diſown'd by him; though when we do it, we only obey his heavenly Call, and bring him nothing, but only all our Deſires and Affections to be govern'd by him. Is there any body ſo abſurd, as to imagine we muſt not give up our ſelves to be led and guided by him in his ways? and when we are in them, does any body think we came there without his Motion and gracious attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Would you have us without any more a do conclude, that all the promiſed bleſſings are our portion? or muſt we not firſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded our Saviour tells us the truth of God, and then purpoſe to learn of him and obey him, and next ſet our ſelves with all our might to ſubdue every Thought and Paſſion to his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and laſt of all, order all our actions (by the aſſiſtance of the ſame Grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <pb n="151" facs="tcp:110369:83"/>we do the reſt) according to the Rule of his Laws? And muſt we not have a ſenſe that we are ſincere in all this, before we can reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably expect that he ſhould give us all the good things he promiſes? In ſhort, muſt he not give us his Grace to will and to do, and muſt we not receive it, and effectually do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all that I have ſaid, before we conclude our Sins are pardoned, and take the confidence to hope our Saviour will give us eternal Life?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> know God and his Attributes better, and perceive how all Religion depends on that Knowledge: <hi>I</hi> think alſo, <hi>I</hi> underſtand the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Religion in General, and of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in particular more exactly, than <hi>I</hi> did. <hi>I</hi> know wherein Religion conſiſts; with the grounds of Faith, and the Reaſon why I am a Chriſtian rather, than of any other Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And withal, I hope I underſtand many places of Holy Scripture, and am able to give a clearer &amp; ſoberer account of them than here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore; whenas I ingeniouſly confeſs, I was wont to expound the Word of God by fanſie, and not by ſerious &amp; attentive Conſiderations. And as for growth in goodneſs, I may truly
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:110369:84"/>ſay, I have learnt many things to be my Duty, which I ſcarce ever heard you ſpeak of. As for example, to bridle my Tongue; eſpecially when I ſpeak of my Superiors; to reverence my Governors; to live in obedience to Laws, though they happen to hinder my private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; &amp; for that end to look upon humane Laws, as binding the Conſcience; to anſwer my Betters with great Modeſty and Humility: in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, not to contend boldly and malepertly with the Prieſt, as if I were upon equal ground with him; not to be a Buſy-body, &amp; a Gadder from houſe to houſe; not to pry into every bodie's Secrets: not to rejoyce in iniquity, or take a pleaſure in hearing of the Sins of the contrary party; to be very fearful of making a Schiſm in the Church; and to name no more, to take heed of itching Ears, and not to run from my own Church, out of a fanſie that I can profit more in other places.</p>

Which is an arrant Lie; as will be made good, if need be, againſt the beſt of you. For it began to break in upon us when the Biſhops &amp; all good Order was thrown down, and the Kingdom put into Arms. Then men ran into exceſs of Riot, when their was no Reſtraint upon them. I will not ſay into ſo much Drunkenneſs, but into Whoring (I may add Atheiſm and Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) and ſuch like Wickedneſs, which are ſaid now to be the reigning ſins. And though men were not preſently openly laſcivious and profane (for the older Wickedneſs grows, the bolder it is;) yet then they got looſe from their Chains, and theſe works of Darkneſs ſecretly lurk'd, and were privately practiſed.</p>

But I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not allow them to be ſuch excellent Chriſtians as you imagine: they rather appear to me with many Deformities. For they are ever wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling about little Ceremonies. They break the Peace of the Church by this means, and ſeem to make no ſcruple about it. They are fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and peeviſh, greedy of Riches, ſtubborn in their Opinions, and by no means can bear with any man differing from them in matters of Doctrine. In ſhort, I ſee a ſtrang Ignorance mixt with Preſumption &amp; Wilfulneſs, not without a high degree of Superſtition, in thoſe whom you admire for godlineſs. But then there is a ſort of people who injoy that name among you, in whom I can ſee nothing but an humour of Deſpiſing and Railing at all ancient received Cuſtoms, <pb n="156" facs="tcp:110369:86"/>how good ſoever; Together with a ſullen De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and ſuch a turbulent nature, as will give no reſt to themſelves or others. And they have one peculiar Quality, proper to themſelvs alone; which is to revile our Miniſters even as they go along the ſtreets: a thing which I could never obſerve our ungodly people to be guilty of towards your Miniſters, who may paſs peaceably enough: nay, I think is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in any Country in the World, where they are of different Religions. Perhaps you will ſay, that ours would do it, did not the power of the Lord over-awe them and ſhut up their Mouths, that they may not reproach his faithful Servants.

                  <hi>I,</hi> and they ſhould be taught not to think themſelves godly too ſoon. Whereas the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hath been quite contrary, to breed in them an opinion of their Piety, if they be but a praying people, and follow Ordinances, and frequent private meetings. And when they are taught on ſuch eaſie terms to call themſelves <hi>gracious</hi> and <hi>godly,</hi> then your Miniſters make this an Argument againſt us, that all or moſt of the Godly are on their ſide. And now it comes into my mind, that this was the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence wherewith they countenanced the late Rebellion, as now <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe, you will give <pb n="160" facs="tcp:110369:88"/>us leave to call it. But to let you ſee how idle and frivolous ſuch Arguments were, and that they might ſerve any bodies purpoſe; it was not long before you were numbred among the ungodly: For the Army learnt to call themſelvs the only <hi>godly party,</hi> and in a manner excluded you. Though I believe You would have lik'd it well enough, if a Painter had drawn a man with his Eyes lifted up to Heaven and one hand on his Breaſt, with the other Hand in his Neighbors purſe, or cutting of his Throat; and writ over it this Inſcription, <hi>An Army-Saint.</hi> I mean, you thought them an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly &amp; untoward generation. But whatſoever you thought, the Argument was as plauſible &amp; ſuccesful for them as it had been &amp; is for you: for the people were ſtrangely drawn away by it. This cut off the King's Head; that it was for the ſafety of the godly. This was in a fair way to keep our preſent Soveraign from returning to us; that thoſe that feared the Lord were againſt it, and would be undone by it. And I find that to this day this pretence of godlineſs hath left an impreſſion on ſome peoples minds, and excuſes all thoſe impieties. For not long ſince I heard one commending them for <hi>a very gracious people:</hi> and when it was ſoberly objected, that they were unjuſt, &amp; even Cruel, and Falſe, and Turbulent, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to their own Governors, and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers of the Nation; it was anſwered, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <pb n="161" facs="tcp:110369:88"/>all theſe things, there was more
<hi>Grace</hi> among them than there is to be found now-adays. Meaning,
<hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe, by their Grace, that they were a <hi>praying people,</hi> and much <hi>in ſeeking God.</hi> As if S. <hi>Paul</hi> did not underſtand himſelf when he told us, that <hi>the Grace of God teaches us to deny ungodlineſs</hi> and <hi>all Worldly Luſts;</hi> and <hi>to live ſoberly, righteouſly,</hi> and <hi>godly in the World.</hi> And to deal Freely with you; <hi>I</hi> am much afraid there are many of this kind of Godly people whom you aſſociate your ſelves withal, <hi>I</hi> am ſure, ſome of thoſe who were Patrons to their wickedneſs, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if not juſtified, the killing of the KING, and were Army-Chaplains; and now private Preachers, and not a little adored.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> that all this Wickedneſs which I have deſcribed from the Apoſtle will conſiſt with a <hi>Form</hi> or ſhew of Godlineſs. For that's a part of the character of theſe very men, verſ.
5. <hi>Having a Form of Godlineſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I collect from hence, that, thoſe men have the <pb n="165" facs="tcp:110369:90"/>
                  <hi>Power of godlineſs</hi> who are of a diſpoſition quite oppoſite to them now named: <hi>Such, I</hi> mean, <hi>as deny themſelvs for God's and their Neighbor's ſake; that ſet not their hearts upon getting Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; that are humble and modeſt; that reverence their Governors, and ſtudy in word and deed to preſerve their Authority; that honour their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, though not of their Opinion, or perhaps ungodly; that are ſenſible of Benefits, and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to their Benefactors; that ſtudy Purity and Chaſtity; that are kind and tenderly-affected to their Relations; that keep their Faith, and perform their Promiſes, though to their own damage; that are eaſily reconciled, if they have been groſly inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; that ſpeak well if they can, of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and are not ready to believe every Story of them; that endeavor to preſerve an even Temper; that command their paſſions, are ſteady and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in their Actions; that are meek and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; peaceable and ſociable; that love Vertue whereſoever they ſee it, and do not deſpiſe or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it under the name of meer Morality; that are faithful to their Truſt; ſober, adviſed and conſiderate in their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakings; that have no high Opinion of themſelves, and love God above all things; that chooſe rather to keep at home, and mind their own Concerns, than to be prying into the Secrets of their Neighbors Houſes; that have no other Deſign upon any, either Man or Woman, than to make them good; and further their increaſe in true Wiſdom.</hi> Theſe, and ſuch
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:110369:91"/>like men in whatſoever place you find them, undoubtedly have <hi>the Power of Godlineſs,</hi> though they ſhould not talk of it ſo much, as others?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I ſee you are able to preach, if you liſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>If I ſhould think ſo, I ſhould run into the company of thoſe <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>high-minded</hi> men, whom I now ſpake of. I can only repeat a good Sermon to you, which I have heard.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>You would have me preach, or at leaſt make a piece of a Sermon; for you told me you would leave me to gather the reſt from your diſcourſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>It's profitable to Preach to <hi>your ſelf</hi> ſuch things as you read and hear, and to preſs upon your Heart ſuch Truths, as you cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve plainly follow from them, though they were not named.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>And what do you think I ſhould ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from what I have heard you ſay?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I told you it would be beſt to leave you to conſider what farther Uſe is to be made of this Character. But if you would have me direct you; then you may be pleaſed to conſider, when you are alone by your ſelf, whether any part of it belong to thoſe, whom you call Godly or to thoſe whom we eſteem ſo: or, which is all one, you may conſider whether thoſe oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Qualities, wherein I told you the <hi>Power of godlineſs conſiſts,</hi> be to be found moſt among your, or our Godly. Always carrying this in your mind, that we do not call all them Godly
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:110369:91"/>who are of our Party, as you are wont to do. Our Miniſters, I aſſure you, will not allow them to enjoy this name, who are Lovers of themſelves, Covetous, Boaſters, Proud, Falſe, Fierce, Heady, &amp;c. But whether many ſuch do not paſs with you for Godly men, and cry out againſt the Form of Godlineſs, while they have little elſe, I leave you to judg.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, I thought once that the <hi>Power of Godlineſs</hi> had conſiſted in keeping the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, in repeating Sermons, having a Gift of Prayer, and uſing it in our Families, treaſuring up and communicating Experiences, and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together to exerciſe our Gifts. And, now it comes into my mind on a ſudden, this is a thing which hath made me fear you want at leaſt a great deal of the power of Godlineſs, that you never <hi>keep a Day</hi> together.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Strange! I thought on the Contrary, that this had been one of our Accuſations; our keeping too many days.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Really, I never heard that any of you kept one.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>What did you never hear, that we have a Holy-day at leſt once a Moneth, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, which we always obſerve?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Piſh! I perceive you underſtand not my Language. I mean, that we keep a private Day together, which we ſet apart for Prayer, and humbling our ſelves before God, and hearing the Word.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:110369:92"/>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Alas! How ſhould I gueſs at your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! when as I thought you would have kept no Days but that of God's appointing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, we can keep other Days, and think we ought, at leaſt that there is much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Why then will you not keep thoſe which your Governors appoint? Have you power to appoint Days, and not they? I am ſorry to ſee your partiality, and that you are ſo full of Humour, as not to do things when you are bidden, and yet to do the ſame when you are not bidden, nay, when you are forbidden.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>O, but we do not keep days, as you do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>What's that to the Purpoſe? Seeing what we do is good, why ſhould you not joyn with us in it? You pray, and ſo do we: You read the Scriptures and ſo do we: you give thanks to God, and that's part of our Buſineſs. Only we do it in publick, and you in private; we when our Governors would have us, and you when it pleaſes your ſelves.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>We not only pray, but hear a Sermon alſo, when we keep our Days.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>So you may at ſome of our Churches, if you pleaſe, every Holy-day. But what a fooliſh Conceit is this, to think that this makes a Day not to be well obſerved, if we want a Sermon? This is a piece of the
<hi>Superſtition</hi> I told you of. For was it not always the chief Deſign of thoſe Days we obſerve, to acknowledg God, to <pb n="169" facs="tcp:110369:92"/>praiſe him in all his wonderful Works, to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on his admirable mercy in ſending his Son, in giving him to dy for us, in raiſing him from the dead, in ſending the Holy Ghoſt, and after that the bleſſed Apoſtles to preach the Goſpel? And is not this ſufficient work for one Day? Or cannot we meditate upon the holy Scriptures the read, or on the Sermon we heard the Lord's Day before; but we muſt needs have a new Sermon, or elſe think God is not glorified, nor well pleaſed? I am amazed at the groſs Abſurdity of ſuch Fancies.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>You may be ſo; but we ſhall never leave them, nor come to Church, till you have more than Common prayer on thoſe Days.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot underſtand any Reaſon for that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. For if you be not ſatisfied with our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but yet muſt needs have ſomething elſe; why do you not come to the publick Prayers &amp; Praiſes firſt and then make up their Defects (as you conceive) in your private Meetings? Or why do you not ſeek and endeavour that theſe dayes may be kept more Religiouſly, ſeeing publick Praiſing God is far better than private, and doth him more honour in the World? For my part, I verily think (and I ſpeak it ſincerely) that if you would come to Church, and there joyn in the publick Service of God, and then go home, and ſpend ſome other part of the Day in Catechiſing your Children, inſtructing your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, teaching them among other matters, how <pb n="170" facs="tcp:110369:93"/>to uſe the Liberty You then allow them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly and ſoberly, and in viſiting, inviting or relieving your poor Neighbours; it would be a thing far more acceptable to God, and more for the honour of Chriſtian Religion, and the good of Souls, than a whole day of Prayer and hearing Sermons.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I am not yet of that mind.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Why? look over all the Families you know, and ſee if many of them be not miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly neglected, whilſt their Maſters and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes are <hi>keeping Dayes,</hi> as you call it. And then tell me, whether they ſpend their time to ſo much Profit and true Comfort as I would have them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I think ſome may be too negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Why do not your Miniſters chide them, and exhort the good Women to keep more at home, &amp; not, under a notion of Religion, neglect their neceſſary Duties? It were eaſy to tell you of ſome who are the worſt Wives, and Mothers, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, in the Pariſh, meerly upon this account, that moſt of their time hath been taken up in gadding about to thoſe private Exerciſes. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times you are mightily offended at our Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days upon this account, that they take up too much of mens times from their Buſineſs; &amp; yet you can be content to ſee a Day ſet a-part every Week, if not oftner, by your ſelves, to the great Dammage of many Families. And ſo, <pb n="171" facs="tcp:110369:93"/>when the Fit is upon you, we are told that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates ought not to bind the people to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Days, which is to make that neceſſary which God hath left free: But yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding you your ſelves ſtick not to lay ſuch a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity upon men of obſerving Dayes, now and then, as if there were a Divine Commandment for it; for you think they have no Religion, or want the Power of it, that do not. And what a ſtir do you keep to have Lectures on the Week-days; as if we were
<hi>dead,</hi> and had but <hi>a Name to live,</hi> unleſs we hear a Sermon or two, then? whereas very good Chriſtians, perhaps, have no more time to ſpare from their honeſt Imployments, than they ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow in private Prayer and Meditation; digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what they heard the Sunday before; ſearching ſeriouſly into their Conſciences, and conſtant Examination of their Lives and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; in conferring with their Miniſters about their Doubts, or thoſe Indiſpoſitions, or, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ill Inclinations, which they find in their Souls; in Comforting the poor and the ſick; in Endeavouring to reconcile Differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Neighbors; in conſulting how to advance the publick Good either of the City or Town where they live, and diſcharging the publick Office well, to which they may be called. If af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this done, they can find any leiſure to hear a Sermon, who is there that forbids it? We are only afraid, leſt whilſt the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <pb n="172" facs="tcp:110369:94"/>of that is ſo much urged, things more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſhould be neglected.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>You ſay a great many notable things; but yet to me you ſeem
<hi>a man of a ſlight Spirit,</hi> which you betray when you ſpeak of theſe weighty matters.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>If you mean that I ſlight many of thoſe things which you think matters of great weight and moment; I cannot contradict you. But why you ſhould thence conclude, I have a <hi>ſlight Spirit,</hi> I ſee no cauſe: For therefore I ſlight them, becauſe I have throughly conſider'd and examin'd them, and find there is nothing but Fanſie or Superſtition at the bottom of them. Miſtake me not; your honeſt Affections I do not ſlight, but the things to which you are ſo affected. As for inſtance, you abound in inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Phraſes, and Scripture-Expreſſions miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied: You have a great many Superſtitious Conceits &amp; Opinions, and oftimes alledg your Experiences very abſurdly—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, now you diſcover your ſelf. Doth not this argue a profane Spirit, to <hi>ſlight Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> when the Apoſtle mentions Chriſtian Experience as a part of our Rejoycing and Glory? <hi>Rom.</hi>
5.4.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I do not ſlight <hi>his</hi> Experiences, but <hi>yours;</hi> and not all of <hi>yours</hi> neither. For if by your Experience you meant, that you had made a proof of your Conſtancy and Faithfulneſs to
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> by patient enduring of any Affliction for
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:110369:94"/>Righteouſneſs ſake; and made a Trial alſo of his Faithfulneſs, in performing his promiſes of giving us Strength, Support, and Comfort, (which I conceive is the Apoſtle's meaning:) I ſhould accuſe my ſelf of great Profaneneſs ſhould I ſlight it. But when you will needs give me this word for a proof of a thing of which I know you have no Experience, and perhaps can have none; and when you alledg your Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in a matter of Reaſon, and in effect ſay no more than this, I pray believe me: you muſt not take it ill, if I make light of it. As for example, when you will tell us, you find by Experience that you are in the right way; it is a thing that may be entertain'd with a ſmile. It is in truth no better than to ſay, you may take my word for it. For whether you be in the right or no, is not to be known by Experience, but by Reaſon. In like manner, if you tell me you find by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence your Miniſter is a good man becauſe he doth you good; it is a frivolous Argument, and <hi>I</hi> may be allow'd to ſlight it; for it cannot be known by your Experience, what he is. You can only know by your Experience, that you are made better; but he may be bad enough not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding. As the <hi>Quakers</hi> were reform'd of Cheating and Couſenage in ſome places by thoſe, who there is great reaſon to ſuſpect, were cheating knaves themſelves.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>But <hi>I</hi> may know by Experience whether the things he preaches be true or no.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:110369:95"/>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>It will deceive you, if you rely upon that Proof. For you may have ſome good done you by falſe Principles. Nay, thoſe very Principles may make you do ſome things well, which ſhall make you do other things ill.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>That's ſtrange.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Not ſo ſtrange, as true. For what Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple was it that led the <hi>Quakers</hi> to be juſt in their dealing?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>That they ought to follow the Light within them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>This led them alſo to be rude and clown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and diſreſpectful to Governors. For all is not Reaſon, that is in us: there is a world of Fanſie alſo: and the Flaſhes of this now and then are very ſudden and amazing; juſt like Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out of a Cloud. By this they find they were miſ-led in many things, which they have now forſaken; being content to wear Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and Ribbons too, which they ſo much at the firſt abominated.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I take them to be a deluded people.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>And yet they are led, they will tell you, by Experience. For they found themſelvs amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by entring into that Religion, whereas they cheated and couſened in all other Forms wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were before. And therefore do not tell me any more of the good you have got by your private meetings, nor make it an argument of their Lawfulneſs. For the ſame Argument will be uſed againſt your ſelvs by the <hi>Quakers;</hi> who
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:110369:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>will tell you, God is in no private Meetings but only theirs, for otherwhere they could never find him. Take your choice: and either let it alone your ſelves, or elſe allow it them. It will either ſerve both, or neither.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>But I have ſeen you ſmile, if one bring his Experience to prove the truth of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and very deſervedly: Becauſe the Ground upon which we believe it to be true, cannot be known by Experience; nor is your Experience of any thing in it a Ground for any other man to believe it. You cannot know, for inſtance, by your Experience, that our Saviour was born of a Virgin, that the Holy Ghoſt came upon him at his Baptiſm with a Voice from Heaven, ſaying,
<hi>This is my well-beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> You cannot know by that means that he dyed, that he roſe the third day, that he went to Heaven forty dayes after, and after ten dayes more gave the Holy Ghoſt; and that <hi>S. Paul</hi> was ſtruck blind with the Glory of our Saviour, whom

                  </gap> ſaw and heard, and was ſent by him to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, I feel that he and the reſt of the Apoſtles ſpeak the very truth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>They ſay all theſe things; and do you know them by your feeling? The Apoſtles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, felt, or ſaw, or heard them; but we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do ſo, nor know them by any other means than their Teſtimony.</p>

               <p>What? Do you feel that they ſay true, for inſtance, when they tell you that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our turn'd Water into Wine, and that he raiſed
<hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead?</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>But <hi>I</hi> feel the Commands of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are exceeding good, and agreeable to humane Nature, which the Apoſtles have delivered to us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>That is, you find it good to live ſoberly, and peaceably; to be charitable to others, and to take up your own Croſs with Contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Patience—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>But may not theſe things be felt by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens as well as you? And may not they by Experience commend the practice of theſe Vertues to us?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Then this Experience of the goodneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Commands is no proof of our Creed, by which we are diſtinguiſhed from Heathens. No, nor will your Experience prove to any man that
<hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Commands are excellent, any farther than he believes that you ſay true, <pb n="177" facs="tcp:110369:96"/>when you tell him what trial you have made of the beſt kind of Life, and that you are a perſon fit to judge of the Difference of things.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Methinks I feel that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is in the Heavens, and in great Power and Glory there.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Whatſoever you feel in this matter, it is the <hi>Effect</hi> of your belief, not the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of it. I mean, you firſt believe, that he is in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; before you can feel any good hopes in your Soul of immortal Life. And you believe his being in Glory upon good Reaſons; elſe you do not know but entertain your ſelf with a pleaſant Dream, both of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and yours. And laſtly, whatever you feel it is no proof <hi>of the truth of the thing,</hi> but only of <hi>the truth of your Belief.</hi> It is to be proved otherwiſe that <hi>Chriſt</hi> reigns gloriouſly in the Heavens, and is able to bring us into his everlaſting Kingdom: only your being ſo mightily affected with it, proves that indeed you believe it. But you had beſt look you have good Reaſons for your Faith. For all the Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of the Religious men among the <hi>Turks,</hi> prove likewiſe that they believe ſtrongly in <hi>Mahomet:</hi> though I hope, if they quote their Experiences never ſo much, you will not be a Diſciple to their Prophet, and hope he will take you by the hair of the head, and pull you up to Heaven.</p>

               <p>I find that you are able to talk more rationally than I can in theſe matters. But yet I find likewiſe, there is another kind of Spirit in our people than in yours. For they <hi>delight more in Heavenly Diſcourſe,</hi> and are <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes talking of Religion</hi> when they are toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: which argues they are not of ſo <hi>ſlight a Spirit</hi> as others, who love to diſcourſe of unprofitable things.</p>

               <p>Do you and I talk frothily, (as your phraſe is) and ſpend our time in unprofitable Chat? Is this Diſcourſe earthly, and not at all pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Religion? And, deal ſincerely with me, do not you ſometime, when you are together, paſs the time away in ſpeaking againſt Biſhops and Common-Prayer, and the Government? Do you not know ſome that are ever complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Times in which we live, and ſaying the former Dayes were better than theſe? And are the Reaſons of this murmuring ſo Heavenly as you ſuppoſe? Do they not ſay the Nation was in more Credit; and had a better Reputation abroad, and they a better Trade at home, and ſuch like things?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot deny but I have heard ſome <hi>Profeſſors</hi> talk thus. But there are a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that you ſhall ſcarce ever hear talking of any thing elſe but Heaven, and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the buſineſs of their Souls.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>And ſuch people there are in all Parties and Sects in the Chriſtian World; who <pb n="179" facs="tcp:110369:97"/>perhaps are never awhit the better for that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>How irreligiouſly you talk?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Not at all. For unleſs they take a true delight in God, and in that Heavenly Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe above all other things, and unleſs they underſtand what they ſay, and delight alſo to do God's will in all things: I think they had as good be talking of, or doing ſomething elſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Can they poſſibly be better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, that they may. For if they only tumble out a great many words and Phraſes which they have learn'd, they had better be Studying what the Religion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is. And if they talk of thoſe matters meerly as it is a Duty, and be not ſo heavenly-minded as that, whenſoever they have leiſure, it is the greateſt joy that can be to be thinking or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of them; they will do this after a very bad faſhion, when ſome other good thing they might have done better; as, viſited the Sick, inquired after the Wants of the Poor, or ordered ſome Pariſh-buſineſs. And again, unleſs they be very prudent, and do not think they muſt needs draw the Company wherein they are (who are ingag'd, perhaps, in other neceſſary Buſineſs) to hear their diſcourſe; I think their room, as we ſay, would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than their company, or, that it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <pb n="180" facs="tcp:110369:98"/>that they would hold their peace. For if a man take himſelf to be bound in Conſcience to be always ſpeaking of theſe things, (as I doubt many do) it is the effect of
<hi>Superſtition,</hi> which makes Religion a great burthen to a man's ſelf and others. For whether he and the Company be diſpoſed or no, this he thinks is his Buſineſs which he often manages very dully, and without any Taſte: thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Chriſtianity Contemptible, and making himſelf alſo ſtill more flat and indiſpoſed for all honeſt imployments. All which conſidered, I leave you to judge, whether that man had not better have beſtow'd his time otherways; for then he might at the end of it have been good for ſomething, whereas now he is good for nothing at all; but mopiſhly ſits bewailing himſelf, and complaining of the deadneſs of his heart.</p>

               <p>Ought not a man to be always think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Heaven?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>No: He may and ought ſometime to think of other things. And he ſhould do it without any Scruple, not fearing that he is ill imploy'd, when he doth not break God's Commands.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>If it be their choice, and if they do not neglect any neceſſary Buſineſs, nor cenſure others that do not as they do; I have nothing to ſay againſt them. But, as I told you, there are ſo many ſuch like people in all Religions, that you muſt not imagine this is a thing pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to yours. And if they think they offend God, if they do otherwiſe, and if they condemn thoſe that now and then innocently recreate themſelves, and ſigh over them as if they were loſt; they trouble the World and themſelves, to ſay no worſe, a great deal too much with their

               <p>What Authority have they to pronounce that in general terms? Sometimes they may, <pb n="183" facs="tcp:110369:99"/>and ſometime, perhaps, they may not. And beſide this, if we be always bound to do that which is beſt, (which you ſuppoſe) we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tell whether we pleaſe God or no; but ſhall be ingag'd in endleſs Doubts. For it is an hard matter ſometime to diſcern which is beſt: and one thing may appear beſt, when I conſider ſuch and ſuch things; and another will ſeem beſt, when I reflect upon other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And I may verily be perſwaded, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but at a few things, that this thing is beſt for me to do, which indeed is rather bad, and ſhould not be done. As, I may conceive it beſt to wear no Lace, no Ribbans, no fine Cloth or ſilk, but give all the money I ſpend in ſuch things to the Poor: whereas this may prove very pernicious, though it have a ſhew of great piety; and maintain many poor in idleneſs, that love not Work; and ſpoil the Labors and Trade of many others, who would not live idlely. Farther, how much time muſt we paſs in reſolving which is beſt in every action we do? as whether it be beſt to eat now, or ſtay a while longer; to drink this Cup of Wine which is offered me, or refuſe it; to talk with a Friend or to part with him: to viſit a Neighbour, or to ſtay at home? And while we are deliberating in this faſhion, the thing might be done which we had a mind unto; and we might be return'd to that which <pb n="184" facs="tcp:110369:100"/>poſſibly we thought would be beſt. It is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, therefore, that we be well imploy'd; and we ought not to torment our ſelves, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend our time in fears, leſt we have not done the beſt. Let us but conſider, whether no neceſſary Duty toward God or Man, that we are capable of, will be neglected, when we go to divert our ſelves; and then we ſhould not ſpoil our innocent Delights with needleſs Jealouſies.</p>

               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>But ſurely this liberty you give, will do people hurt, for they are apt to take too much of it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Many will take it, whether we give it them or no. But I can aſſure you there are many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent perſons of extraordinary piety (whom I know) who will not take it, though we give it. Not that they think it an unlawful thing, as you do; but they have no uſe for that Liberty. They are above ſuch pleaſures, and can find imployment or ingenious Divertiſement that is far more ſweet to them. I know others that ſcruple not the thing at all, and yet judge it not ſo expedient for them in their place and relation; and ſo wholly forbear it: which is a far greater Vertue than that which you boaſt of; as much as it is more noble to abſtain from thoſe pleaſures we think lawful, than to be reſtrained only from thoſe which we think are ſinful, I am acquainted with others alſo that <pb n="185" facs="tcp:110369:100"/>go to Plays, but very rarely, only for a harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Recreation when they are dull, or to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company a Friend, that earneſtly importunes their company. And theſe, methinks, are as much above thoſe, whoſe Piety you ſo much admire; as it is an harder thing to abſtain from the pleaſures of which we have taſted, and find to be very agreeable to us, than to forbear thoſe, to which we are ſtrangers, and know nothing of. Beſides theſe, I know o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that go oftner; and yet I dare not ſay, they are not pious, becauſe I ſee by all their actions that they love God and Man. And I have heard them ſay, that the time they ſpend on that faſhion, doth not hinder them in any Chriſtian Duty that they know of, (and yet they are not negligent to inform themſelves) and is a great deal better ſpent than in talking againſt ones Neighbours, or hearing others rail upon the ill management of Affairs, and find fault with the times, or ſuch like things.</p>

               <p>It is true. But they want company, &amp; they can find little of any fort, where thoſe things are not their entertainment. And it is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, that ſuch people paſs for Godly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, who ſpend many hours in talk of that nature now mention'd, and therefore we would fain know why we may not with better reaſon <pb n="186" facs="tcp:110369:101"/>call thoſe Godly that go to Plays, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways are unreproveable. I ſay with better Reaſon; both becauſe this is at leaſt more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent (if it be not perfectly blameleſs) than backbiting ones Neighbours; and our Godly do nothing but what they allow, whereas yours do that which they cannot but condemn. I am alſo of the opinion, that our Miniſters ſpeak as often (if not more frequently) againſt the exceſſive uſe of that Recreation; as yours do againſt all Bitterneſs, Wrath, Anger, Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting, and Evil-ſpeaking, which are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unlawful.</p>

I could wiſh alſo there were not ſo many acted, becauſe they invite men, perhaps, too often to them. But tell me, I pray you, why one may not as well look upon a Picture, as upon the man himſelf whom it repreſents? or, why a Painter ſhould be commended, and a Player condemned?</p>

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:110369:101"/>there repreſent, why may you not ſee both the things and the Repreſentation of them, if you have a mind? Nay, tell me why they that do, ſhould not be thought to ſpend their time as well as you, that can hear long Stories of the Biſhops, or of ſuch and ſuch a Parſon, (as you in ſcorn, though very fooliſhly, call our Miniſters; for ſome of them are but Vicars, and you your ſelvs would be glad to hold a good Parſonage, as many Lay-men do) or of ſome of your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors; whoſe Life and (perhaps) domeſtick and private Affairs, you having pry'd into, can be talking of half a day together? This is, in truth, no better than hearing of a Play; only you do not ſee it. That is, you hear the ſame things, that others both hear and ſee acted in a Play; and there is a great deal of Art, and Wit, and Fancie, and you have none.</p>

Do not caſt them out of the Houſe of God meerly becauſe they go to a Play-houſe; But hope, that though you are gilt more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, yet they may be as good Metal as you.

               <p>A great deal plainer than <hi>W.

<hi>God hath a very great Cup board of plate in this Nation, Chriſt hath much plate in</hi> England, <hi>as much as in any Nation in the World; and he will not loſe his plate.</hi> But he will not tell us how he is gone, nor when he went, nor what drove him away, nor what his Return will be, no nor what mark there is upon the plate, whereby we may know it. And I doubt you would not be well pleaſed, if I ſhould go about to gueſs what he means by all this.</p>

               <p>You cannot excuſe him ſo; for the Title of his Sermon tells you that it relates either to a Soul, or to a Nation.

               <p>True: But his meaning is plainly this; that he would be quite gone, but that he and ſuch like are here. Were but they removed, God would have no dwelling among us. It's they that lay hold on him, and will not let him totally depart. They are his Plate, and as long as that remains, he hath ſomething to ingage his affections, and ſo will not perfectly abandon the Nation. But for all that, he complains ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as if the Lord had abhorred and caſt us off; telling us, <hi>that Chriſt is offended, his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel <pb n="190" facs="tcp:110369:103"/>Inſtitutions trampled on, and that it is not an eaſie thing to bring him back.</hi> And it is very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if he had thought of it, he would have told you, <hi>That the Plate upon the Cup-board is thrown down, the Plate is batter'd and bruiſed, the Plate is abuſed and ſoil'd.</hi> For he tells his Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>You are in a ſuffering day,</hi> p. 478.</p>

               <p>Why! that Sermon hath more of Fiction in it than many of the Plays. For they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times grounded upon an Hiſtorical truth: but he entertain'd the people in his Theatre with a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant piece of his own pure Invention; telling a Story of God's Departure, and of his coming back again, &amp; their excelling other men as much as a Cup-board of Plate doth common Furniture and of their remaining here as a pledge of his <pb n="191" facs="tcp:110369:103"/>Return; when as there is no ſuch thing, but only in his and their Fancy. Only one thing, I obſerve, he very wiſely conceals, leſt it ſhould happen to prove in their conceit a plain Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. For having ſaid, in order to aſſure them of God's Return, <hi>that if a man have left Plate and Jewels in his Houſe, he will either come back to them, or ſend for them away to him;</hi> this pleaſant Gentleman, ſuppoſing his Hearers (together with his <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Worſhip, i. e.</hi> their Opinions and way of ſerving God) to be the Plate; would not diſturb their Fancies by telling them that, according to the ſtate of that Reſemblance, God will either return to them, or ſend for them to him, but tells them abſolutely, he will return again to them. Read his words, (<hi>p</hi> 477.) <hi>Such Plate the Lord hath much of here, and he will not loſe his Plate; therefore he will return again, though he may afflict, and afflict ſorely, yet he will return again. And a little after</hi> (p. 482.) <hi>As ſure as the Morning is after the Night, ſo ſure will God return. His going forth is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared as the Morning: as certain he will return as the Morning doth.</hi> This I muſt needs ſay, was kindly ſaid, and like a Poet; who can invent what he pleaſes, and leave out what makes not for his turn.</p>

               <p>Then it is very hard to know what it is. And, indeed, the Aſſembly of Divines, when they direct men how to perform their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and among other things, tell them they muſt preach <hi>plainly,</hi> do not ſpeak plainly them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Directory, <hi>i. e.</hi> not ſo as to be underſtood. For theſe are their words, <hi>pag.</hi> 17. <hi>The Servant of</hi> Chriſt <hi>is to perform his whole Miniſtry,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Plainly, that the meaneſt may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, delivering the Truth, not in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing words of man's wiſdom; but in Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit and of Power, leſt the Croſs of</hi> Chriſt <hi>ſhould be made of none effect.</hi> Now ſince you acknowledge they cannot propheſy, nor ſpeak with Tongues, nor Demonſtrate their Doctrine by Miracles, as the Apoſtles did; I would gladly know what they mean by the Demonſtration of the Spirit, and of Power.

               <p>But you would ſee them ſo often in the Pulpit, that you do not allow them time for that, and other Miniſterial Duties. Hence it is, that upon all occaſions they apply the Holy Scriptures, very impertinently, and interpret them negligently, and alledge that for a Proof, which is nothing to the purpoſe, nay, quite contrary to that which they maintain. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<hi>W. B.</hi> who from that place in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 6.3. <hi>(his going forth is prepared as the Morning)</hi> would have his people believe, that God will as <hi>certainly</hi> return to them, as the morning is after night. Whereas that is only ſpoken to the Ten Tribes, and the Prophet doth
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:110369:105"/>not give them an abſolute aſſurance that they ſhall return to their own Land; but only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites them to Repentance, and on that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion promiſes; God in a little time will revive them. Nay, he requires not only that they ſhould begin to <hi>know God</hi> whom they had forſaken; but that they ſhould <hi>continue and perſevere to know him:</hi> and then, ſaith he, <hi>his going forth is prepared as the Morning, i. e.</hi> he was ready to comfort them, as the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-light doth thoſe that wait for it; <hi>and would come upon them as the Rain,</hi> which quickens and calls back the Corn to life, which otherwiſe would have lain dead in the Earth. It is true, <hi>W. B.</hi> ſaith a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>if you deſire God ſhould return to you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn you to him;</hi> as if there were ſome conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the buſineſs. But this is only his uſual way of ſaying, and unſaying; of granting promiſes to be <hi>Conditional,</hi> which he would have his people believe ſhall be performed <hi>abſolutely.</hi> And, indeed, ſo much he had told them before this, that they might not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforted, though they did not return to God. <hi>Friends,</hi> ſaith he (<hi>pag.</hi> 478.) <hi>there is a time when God will deliver his people for his Names ſake, and with a notwithſtanding, i. e.</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their Sins, and notwithſtanding all his Diſpleaſures, as he explains himſelf. Now if you would know when that time is, he tells us, <hi>When a people ſuffer for God's
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:110369:106"/>Name's ſake, then God will deliver for his Name's ſake, then God will deliver with a not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,</hi> And this he would have them believe is their preſent ſtate and condition. <hi>How is it with you now?</hi> (they are his words) <hi>you are in a ſuffering day; but are not all your ſufferings for the Name of</hi> Chriſt? <hi>Be of good comfort then; though God may be departed, and your City deſtroyed, yet he is not quite gone, but will return again:</hi> that is, notwithſtanding all their Sins, he would not leave them. Do you not ſee how confident he is? This it is, for men to fanſy themſelves <hi>at the Fathers knee, and to be in his arms, and held in his Embraces, held in his Smiles,</hi> (as he ſpeaks,
<hi>p.</hi> 469.) They ſay even what they pleaſe, when they are full of this conceit; and think it is the Oracles of God. They tell you their own mind, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is the mind of the Lord. And when they tell it you in ſuch delicate Expreſſions as theſe, or ſuch rude and groſs ones as thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned; you call it <hi>plain Preaching,</hi> and <hi>powerful Preaching.</hi>

<hi>plain Preaching</hi> is, in that very place which you quoted; where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Miniſters to forbear unprofitable uſe of unknown Tongues, ſtrange Phraſes, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Sounds and Words, and to cite Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences out of Writers ſparingly, though never ſo Elegant.</p>

               <p>By your favour, this is only one part of that which they call plain preaching. For firſt, they ſay a Miniſter muſt preach in the Demonſtration of the Spirit, and of Power: and then it follows,
<hi>Abſtaining alſo from an unprofitable uſe,</hi> &amp;c. So that ſtill we are to ſeek what that <hi>Preaching with Power</hi> means. And as for this ſort of plain preaching now mention'd, either your Miniſters do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, or do not mind it. For who hath more <hi>ſtrange Phraſes</hi> than <hi>W. B.?</hi> Or, (to paſs by him, who it's like regards not the Directory) who is there that ſtuffs his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons with more Shreds of Authors, and more affects little Sayings and Cadences of Sounds and Words, than <hi>T. W.</hi> As for his <hi>Power</hi> in preaching, I ſhewed you before how unable it is to Rouze and Shake an Hypocrite, and bring him to Repentance. For he ſtudies rather to pleaſe him with the enticing words of mans Wiſdom, (though after a poor faſhion) than to make a plain Repreſentation of his Wretched State and Condition to him. If many of thoſe, whom you deſpiſe, had had the handling of him, they would have turn'd his inſide outward, and ſet it before his eyes: They would have ript his very Heart, and diſcovered his Entralls; that he might have beheld how he ſtands di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided between God and the World. He ſhould have ſeen how many ſecret Sins he <pb n="198" facs="tcp:110369:107"/>ſuffers to lurk in his Breaſt: Nay, in what a deteſtable manner he reſerves a kindneſs for many of the vileſt Sins; ſuch as are Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Oppreſſion, Hard dealing, Unmerciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Malice, Revenge, Bitterneſs, Wrath, Implacableneſs, and ſuch like; which are the Sins of too many Religious people, that is, of Hypocrites, that are not intire and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in their Religion. For an Hypocrite is not a <hi>meer Player</hi> in Religion, as <hi>T. W.</hi> fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but one that concerns himſelf with a mighty Zeal for ſome good things, and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, would rather die, than not do them, but hath no Affection for the reſt of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. He doth not only put on a Garb of piety to deceive others; but there are a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men that love ſome part of piety, and by that means deceive their own Souls.

               <p>So were the <hi>Phariſees:</hi> For that Sect was more curious and exact in many things than any of the reſt. But theſe two things among many others you ſhall obſerve of them. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that they were very deſirous of <pb n="199" facs="tcp:110369:107"/>the peoples Favour and Eſteem: the deſire of pleaſing, whom I doubt ſometimes betrays your Preachers into ſuch rude and unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſpeeches, as I have heard and ſeen from them. And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> the beſt of them (as appears in S. <hi>Paul</hi>) were carried with a blind prepoſterous Zeal, even againſt the Truth of
<hi>Chriſt;</hi> which aroſe from their high Eſteem of themſelves, and a Confidence they were very dear to God above all others. I wiſh the like Heat, and Conceit of your infallible ſpirit do not now make you violently oppoſe many things which have <hi>Chriſts</hi> Stamp upon them. And then you had beſt examine whether you are not <hi>ſtrict people,</hi> juſt as they are <hi>plain Preachers.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>If you mean that they look ſolemnly, and will not laugh, nor be merry; it is like it's true of ſome of them. But whether this be the effect of their Religion, or their Natural Temper, it is no great matter, for it doth not much commend them. Otherwiſe, <pb n="200" facs="tcp:110369:108"/>if you mean, that they long conſider things, and come not to a Reſolution till it be late; that they ponder all their words and actions, and weigh well what they are going about; I doubt you will find but few of theſe <hi>ſerious</hi> perſons. For to me, the Zeal of moſt of you ſeems to make you heady and raſh. I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, for inſtance, that they are apt preſently to condemn thoſe that are merry; or at leaſt to ſhake their Heads, and expreſs their fears as if they were <hi>too vain and light-Spirited.</hi> This, Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure hath a ſhew of Seriouſneſs, but in truth, proceeds from a want of it. But if you mean, that they are <hi>in good earneſt in their Religion:</hi> So are many of the <hi>Nuns</hi> and <hi>Friars,</hi> and other devout people among the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> ſay their <hi>Ave Maries</hi> and <hi>Pater Noſters,</hi> and would not omit them for all the World. And ſo were the <hi>Phariſees</hi> a very <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious people,</hi> eſpecially upon a Sabbath, and would not neglect their Devotions, in which they were earneſt and long, for any good. And aſſure your ſelf, a man may be ſerious in Religion, and yet be an Hypocrite: That is, he may in good earneſt do many Duties, and love to Pray, and Hear, and Repeat Sermons, and the like; And all the while he may in as good earneſt love the World very much, and (to ſay no more) love the praiſe of men, and Deſire to be better thought of than his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. In ſhort, he may love Money and <pb n="201" facs="tcp:110369:108"/>Eſteem, being Covetous and Cenſorious as the Phariſees were.</p>

               <speaker>N.C.</speaker>
               <p>You love to compare us with the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees. Were they ſuch a
<hi>tender-conſcienc'd people?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes indeed were they, in many things. They would rather dy than break the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: They made a great Scruple of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above ſo many Paces upon that day, and had infinite Ceremonies and Superſtitions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout its Obſervation; of which they were ſo tender, that they could not endure any body elſe ſhould break them. The like Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they had about Idolatry, and many other things. But yet they made no bones (as we ſay) of a Widdow's houſe, which they could devour at one bit as ſoon as the Sabbath was done: They were horribly Covetous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of Riches: They made no Conſcience of Oppreſſion and Extortion: They were monſtrouſly Uncharitable and Proud: They thought themſelves the wiſeſt and the beſt men in the world, and deſpiſed all others, as men that knew not what Religion meant. And leſt you ſhould think they wanted Zeal to increaſe their party, (which they called Love to pure Religion) <hi>they compaſſed Sea and Land</hi> (as <hi>Chriſt</hi> tells you) <hi>to make a Proſelyte,</hi> who, when he was gain'd, <hi>became twofold more the Child of Hell than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> Which thing I would have you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:110369:109"/>becauſe it ſhews us that men may be converted from groſs Prophaneneſs to Sins of a more Spiritual and inviſible nature; to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolical Pride, and Malice, and rage againſt all that oppoſe their Sect. And therefore you would do well to conſider again, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be not many ſuch Converts now that hate us as much as they do Common-Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and are zealous for little elſe but to make men Non-Conformiſts, and to diſgrace thoſe that are not.</p>

               <p>I did not think you would have plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo hard for all the Superſtitions and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious people of your Church. And, to tell you all my mind, I ſhould love your Miniſter better, if he did not ſeem to love the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer ſo well. For he reads it with as much Devotion as he expreſſes in his own pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and beſides, he maintains the Uſe of it, and the things appointed by it, (as you do) in his private diſcourſes.</p>

               <p>In my mind, you ought to like him the better for this, becauſe he is not an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> and doth not that to get a Living which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly diſlikes, nor approves that by publick practice, which he diſallows or diſcommends in private talk. And methinks it argues too much inſincerity in your ſelves, that you could be content, nay glad, that another man ſhould do contrary to his Conſcience and Profeſſion; either in uſing thoſe Prayers <pb n="203" facs="tcp:110369:109"/>which he inwardly diſaffects, or in ſpeaking againſt them (at leaſt ſilently hearing them reproached) when he is convinced of their goodneſs. Above all, I wonder how any honeſt-hearted man can endure him that mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters over the publick Prayers (which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends by his uſe of them to like) without any Spirit or life, on purpoſe to diſgrace them and bring them into contempt; at leaſt to make his own prayers better accepted, and preferr'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>He thereby doth but juſtifie himſelf and his own practice. It ſeems you would have him ſtand like a Fool with his Finger in his Mouth, Meerly to Humour you.

               <p>To ſay the truth, it would be more for the Intereſt of Chriſtianity, if we did. But though you ſeem very deſirous, in a good mood, that we ſhould ceaſe to undermine <pb n="204" facs="tcp:110369:110"/>each the other, and both joyn together to promote ſound Religion and true piety; yet this Fit holds not long. For commonly you labour nothing more than to overthrow the Religion eſtabliſhed; nay, many of you glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in your hopes of this: as if it were a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty matter to pull down a Building, and bring things to Ruine; which is the eaſieſt thing in the world; the work of Ignorance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and, as one of our Miniſters ſaid, <hi>the Paſtime of the Devil, and the Imployment of his Children;</hi> of whom we may ſpeak in the Apoſtles words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Deſtruction and miſery are in their wayes, and the way of Peace have they not known.</hi> In order to this, you diſgrace the Biſhops; undervalue, if not deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe, all our Miniſters; revile the Common-Prayer; accuſe us of Superſtition, Popery, Anti-chriſtianiſm, and what not? You every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where divulge and ſpread abroad the Faults of any of the Clergy; and rejoyce to hear or tell a Story of any drunken <hi>Parſon,</hi> as you are wont to call the beſt of them by way of deriſion.

               <p>Yes, very heartily.

Theſe we cannot well ſuffer to ſtrut as they do, and not endeavour to diſplay their Vanity: Nor can we approve of thoſe who for the ſake of their party, are content to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble it, if not favour their impudent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. For we know well enough how like they are in many things to S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s formal Chriſtians; eſpecially in this one part of their Character, that they are <hi>Deſpiſers of thoſe that are good.</hi> A thing I would by no means <pb n="206" facs="tcp:110369:111"/>be guilty of, and therefore hope you will not ſuſpect my eſteem of you.</p>

               <p>I am glad you are ſo charitably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; and am the more pleaſed, becauſe I thought you had look'd upon us with the greateſt Deteſtation in the world.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>I have already told you, that we do not think you all of a kind, though now you flock together. There are ſome (of your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for inſtance) who I believe are of an humble Spirit, quiet and peaceable in the Land, deſiring Unity and Accord, grieving for the Breach of it; and are ſo far from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thoſe, that are ſatisfied to do what the Law requires, that they are ſorry they cannot contribute to the common Peace by doing the ſame. Upon which account they go as far as they can, and conform to publick Order in all things wherein they are ſatisfied, and are tender of breaking any Laws; and when they cannot obey them, do not rail upon them and their Makers, but ſilently and without any noiſe omit to do what they enjoyn. Theſe we cannot but love; and are ſorry that in ſo great a number we can find ſo few of this good temper. For there is a <hi>ſecond</hi> ſort (with which the Kingdom ſwarms) who are of an haughty Humour, of a furious and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Diſpoſition, puft up with a conceit of their Gifts to ſuch a height, that they will ſcarce allow any man to know any thing of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:110369:111"/>God, who is not of their Party. Sowr and crabbed they are above all other men, croſs and peeviſh beyond all expreſſion: they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpeak well of our Governors or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they are always reviling Biſhops and Common-Prayer; and talking like men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired: it is an eaſy matter for them to diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage all our Miniſtery, and beget an ill opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them in the minds of their credulous Followers. Which we conceiving to be their Buſineſs, no wonder if our men ſeek to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves, not by diſgracing, but by rightly repreſenting them to the World. They ought not to betray the Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they live, by a baſe and unworthy Silence. Even the meaneſt Child of us ought to ſpeak, when you are about to kill our Mother. Your long Nails wherewith you now ſcratch her Face muſt be ſhewn the people; who ſee them not, while they behold your hands lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to Heaven. But beſides theſe two, there is a <hi>third</hi> ſort between both, who are diſſatisfied only with a few things; allow our Miniſters to be good men, and wiſh for Peace, but yet for private reſpects hold fair correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with the Furies now named; keep up the Separation; hold Conventicles; ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the people, without reproof, to be fierce and violent againſt us; connive at a great many of their falſe and abſurd Opinions; let them alone in their rude and inſolent beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; <pb n="208" facs="tcp:110369:112"/>take not ſufficient care to inſtruct them in the Truth, to bring them to a modeſt and peaceable temper; In ſhort, to qualifie them for Compliance with us. Do not ſmile at the word, for I can demonſtrate it might ſoon be brought about, if they pleaſed.</p>

<hi>You gather Churches out of our Churches, and you ſet up Churches in an oppoſite way to our Churches; and all this you do voluntarily, and unwarrantably, not having any ſufficient cauſe for it.

<hi>Chriſt</hi> holds Communion with her, and hath not cut her off (becauſe of any Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies ſhe uſes) from him the Head of the Church.

The former is, when men do peaceably and quietly draw from Communion with a Church, not making a head againſt that Church, from which they are departed: The other is, when perſons ſo withdrawing do conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate and withdraw themſelves into a diſtinct and oppoſite Body, ſetting up a Church againſt a Church;</hi> (which let me tell you by the way, is your Caſe, my good Neighbour) <hi>which</hi> Camero <hi>calls a Schiſm by way of eminency; and <pb n="212" facs="tcp:110369:114"/>farther tells us, there are four Cauſes, that make a ſeparation, from a Church, lawful. Firſt, when they that ſeparate are grievouſly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerably perſecuted: Secondly, when the Church they ſeparate from is Heretical: Thirdly, when it is Idolatrous: Fourthly, when it is the Seat of Antichriſt. And where none of theſe four are found, there the Separation is inſufficient, and Schiſm. Now we are fully aſſured, that none of theſe four Cauſes can be juſtly charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Congregations; therefore you muſt not be diſpleaſed with us, but with your ſelves, if we blame you as guilty of poſitive Schiſm.</hi> What ſay you now, my Neighbour? Was this good Doctrine then, or no? If it was, it is ſo ſtill; and I beſeech you, make good uſe of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Some think it is a ſufficient cauſe to ſeparate, in that there are ſuch ſinful mixtures tolerated among you; and that your Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations are miſcellaneous Companies of all Gatherings, and all ſorts are admitted even to Sacramental Communion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>That's the very Objection which your Miniſters and Elders ſaw framed againſt them by the Separatiſts. And what they anſwer to them; we return to you. Firſt, That this Charge is not true; the Rule of the Church of <hi>England</hi> being as full and ſtrict for Church-Members, that ſhall come to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as that of the Aſſembly there cited,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:110369:114"/>
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 133. which is this: <hi>That they muſt be viſible Sainst, ſuch as, being of age, do profeſs Faith in</hi> Chriſt,
<hi>and obedience to</hi> Chriſt, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of Faith aud Life, taught by</hi> Chriſt <hi>and his appoſtles.</hi> Secondly,
<hi>Suppoſe there were ſome ſinful Mixtures (ſay they) at our Sacraments; yet we conceive this is not a ſufficient ground of a Negative, much leſs of a Poſitive Separation. The Learned Author fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned tells us, that Corruption in Manners crept into a Church, is not a ſufficient cauſe of Separation from it. This he proves from</hi> Math. 23.2, 3. <hi>and he adds alſo this Reaſon for it; Becauſe in what Church ſoever there is Purity of Doctrine, there God hath his Church, though overwhelm'd with Scandals. And therefore whoſoever ſeparates from ſuch an Aſſembly, ſeparates from the place where God hath his Church; which is raſh and unwarrantable. The Church of</hi> Corinth <hi>had ſuch a profane Mixture at their Sacrament, as we believe few (if any) of our Congregations can be charged withal; and yet the Apoſtle doth not perſwade the Godly party to ſeparate, much leſs to gather a Church out of a Church.</hi>

               <p>They have made it theirs, by approving what he ſays, in their Book. And beſides they tell you, <hi>there were many Godly and Learned Non-conformiſts of the laſt Age, that were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:110369:115"/>in their Conſcience they could not hold Communion with the Church of</hi> England <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacrament kneeling, without Sin; yet did they not ſeparate from her. Indeed, in that particular act they withdrew, but yet ſo, as that they held Communion with her in the reſt; being far from a Negative, much more from a Poſitive Separation from her. Nay, ſome of them,</hi> (mind the words) <hi>even then, when our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were full of ſinful Mixtures, with great Zeal and Learning defended them ſo far, as to write againſt thoſe that did ſeparate from them.</hi> who theſe Good and Learned men were, they tell you in the Margin; Mr.

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>This will not ſerve your turn, but you muſt come and joyn in Communion with us again. For they tell you, <hi>that as he, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies a Fundamental Article of the Faith, is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Hereſie, though he add not Obſtinacy thereto, to make him an Heretick: So he that doth unwarrantably ſeparate from the true Church is truly guilty of Schiſm, though he add not Uncharitableneſs thereunto, to denominate him a compleat Schiſmatick.</hi> You may read the words, if you will, <hi>pag.</hi> 137. <hi>And afterward they tell you that to make a Rupture in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and to divide Church from Church, and to ſet up Church againſt Church, and to gather Churches out of true Churches, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we differ in ſome things, therefore to hold Church-Communion in nothing; this, we think, hath no warrant out of the word of God, and will introduce all manner of confuſion in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Families; and not onely diſturb, but in a little time deſtroy the power of Godlineſs, Purity of Religion, Peace of Chriſtians, and ſet open a wide Gap to bring in Atheiſm, Popery, Hereſie, and all manner of wickedneſs.</hi> Thus they. And how faſt all this is a doing by your means, who now will have no Communion <pb n="216" facs="tcp:110369:116"/>with us in any thing, becauſe we differ in ſome things, is apparent to all the world. For the love of God, and of the Church, nay, of your own Families, conſider of it in time, and repent; that ſo they may not be brought to utter Confuſion, but the Gap may be ſtopt, which you have opened too wide already, to Atheiſm, Irreligion, and all the reſt of the Wickedneſs which comes, powring in it ſelf upon us. Do not continue that Separation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer, which you have raſhly begun; leſt you be found guilty of that very thing your ſelves, which you condemned ſo much in others, and profeſs <hi>is by all good men to be abhorred.</hi> Read what I have now ſaid over and over again, and ſeriouſly lay it to heart: leſt your own Books be opened at the day of Judgement, and Sentence be pronounced againſt you out of them. Nay, deſire your Miniſters to read it, and to expound the reaſon to you, why they ſhould ſsparate now more than Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hilderſham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> and ſuch like, did here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore. Intreat them to let you know, how they excuſe thewſelves from the guilt, not only of withdrawing themſelves from our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, (which they call <hi>Negative Schiſm;</hi>) but alſo of making an head againſt us, and drawing themſelves into a diſtinct and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Body, and ſetting up a Church againſt a Church which they call <hi>Poſitive, and Schiſm by way of Eminency,</hi> Ask them which of the <pb n="217" facs="tcp:110369:116"/>four Cauſes of Separation they alledge to make their Departures from us neceſſary: What we have done that ſhould make it unlawful for them to communicate with us; or rather, How we have ſeparated our ſelves from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and made him diſown us. If they be not able to give you very good ſatisfaction in this, and in all the reſt, I hope, you ſee what you are to do, according to their own Advice and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.</p>

               <p>I cannot imagine what they ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, unleſs it be this. But bid them ſhew you what hath befalen them, that ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that name. And likewiſe ſhew, that the Perſecution is grievous, nay, intolerable, (for elſe they have told you it will not warrant a Separation:) and one thing more deſire to learn of them, which is, whether thoſe things that any of them have ſuffered, be not the Effect and Puniſhment of their ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not the Cauſe of it.

Do we abridge the pooreſt Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſo much of his liberty, as then they would have abridg'd all the Nobles in the Land, nay (for any thing I ſee) the <hi>KING</hi> himſelf, at leaſt his Family, which were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the uſe of Common-Prayer under ſuch great Penalties? Are you not all allow'd to worſhip God, juſt as you pleaſe your ſelves in your own Families? Nay, may not ſome of your Neighbours joyn with you, if you and they be ſo minded? For ſhame do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of Perſecution, when you are ſo kindly uſed, who endeavoured in ſuch a manner to oppreſs others.

And there is another thing which to me ſeems ſomething hard, (I am ſure you ought to judg it ſo,) <hi>viz.</hi> an Ordinance of 2. <hi>June</hi> 1646. requiring, <hi>that all people who were come to reſide in the Parliament-Quarters, ſhould take the National League and Covenant, and the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Oath, notwithſtanding any Articles that had been made by the Souldiery.</hi> Why ſhould <pb n="220" facs="tcp:110369:118"/>you complain of the late
<hi>Oxford</hi> Act (as it is commonly called) who could endure hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that men ſhould be uſed ſo ſeverely? Compare that and this Ordinance together, and tell me which of them is moſt moderate; that which baniſhed men out of many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or that which only prohibits their near habitation to a Town or two? that which made void the promiſes which their own Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers had made, or that which was againſt no ingagements at all? I wiſh you would conſider theſe things, with a great many more of like nature; for, though your prejudices are ſtrong, I hope ſometime they may ſerve to convince you. And the mention of the Covenant, juſt now brings a conſiderable thing to my mind, which if it would not be tedious, I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly propound, and deſire you to enquire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>Then I will prove they bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in an Oath againſt the Laws of the Land. For our Laws make the King <hi>Supreme
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:110369:120"/>Governour over all perſons and in all cauſes:</hi> But the Presbyterial Government as it was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> (and was intended to be here) though it allow the King to be Supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour over all
<hi>perſons,</hi> (as they are <hi>his</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects) yet will not ſubject all <hi>Cauſes</hi> to his Government; becauſe Chriſt according to the Diſcipline, <hi>is the only ſpiritual King and Governour over his Kirk.</hi> As much as to ſay, they are ſubject onely to Chriſt in ſome things.</p>

               <p>This is onely a Collection which you make from ſeveral things compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in which you may be deceived. Sure they never intended to ſet up ſuch a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>That you may not be left therefore to my uncertain Reaſonings (as you will eſteem them) in this particular; You may be ſatisfied about the Mind of the Aſſembly, if you be at all acquainted with the Hiſtory of the late Times. By that I am informed, they intended to bring the ſame Government among us that was in <hi>Scotland:</hi> And, Secondly, they thought the Parliament was obliged to ſet it up by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Covenant. When theſe two things are proved, I believe you will be of my mind, that they took an Oath againſt the Laws, and therefore ought not to perſiſt in it, but repent of it.</p>

               <p>You muſt know then that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment declared for Presbyterial Government, and paſſed moſt of the particulars brought them from the Aſſembly without any material alteration; <hi>ſaving the point of Commiſſioners;</hi> as they tell us in a Declaration of <hi>April</hi>

               <p>Have patience, and I will tell you. <hi>Theſe ugly Commiſſioners</hi> ſtood in the way, which the Aſſembly would not admit of; as the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would not admit of their Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>N. C.</speaker>
               <p>Why do you call it ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>The title of the Declaration tells you, that the intention of it is, among other things, to ſecure the people againſt <hi>all Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Government, viz.</hi> in the Church, which they ſpoke of before. But that you may be ſure of it; they let you know, when they come to that part of it, which concerns <hi>Church-Government,</hi> that the Presbytery challeng'd an
<hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> which they could not grant. The reaſon was, becauſe they would have ſet up <hi>ten thouſand Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories within the Kingdom</hi> which ſhould have had a ſupreme Authority over us in many things. <hi>And this was demanded in ſuch a way</hi> (as they proceed to tell us) <hi>as is not conſiſtent with the Fundamental Laws and Government
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:110369:121"/>of the ſame, and by neceſſary conſequence excluding the Power of the Parliament of</hi> England <hi>in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of that Juriſdiction.</hi> This was the very cauſe (as they farther inform us) why they had ſettled no Government ſince their ſitting, becauſe
<hi>they could not ſubject themſelves and the People of the Land,</hi> to ſo vaſt a power as the Presbytery challeng'd; <hi>which,</hi> they tell us a little after, <hi>would have been for the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to part with ſome of his Power out of his hands.</hi> Now before we go any farther, I pray tell me, who was the ſupreme Civil Magiſtrate then, but the <hi>KING?</hi> And how will you excuſe theſe men from going about to rob him of a part of his Power, and wreſt it out of his hands?</p>

               <p>We ſhall try that by and by. But that you may better know how they meant to go to work, and to over rule the Supreme Power in many Cauſes; you muſt underſtand theſe things. That it being reſolved by both Houſes, that all perſons guilty of notorious and ſcandalous Offences ſhould be ſuſpended from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; the Aſſembly likewiſe reſolved, that theſe two Powers lay in the Elderſhip or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and only in them.

                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:110369:121"/>Power out of his hands, which is contrary to the Law of God: And therefore they ought not any longer to hold themſelves bound by it; but rather ſhould repent, as they adviſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to do in that caſe. To ſum up the whole buſineſs. An Oath that is not warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Laws of God and the Land ought to be repented of. Your Miniſters took an Oath not warranted by the Laws of God and the Land, but contrary to them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought to repent of it. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Propoſition, is their own. The latter is partly theirs, and partly the Commons of <hi>England.</hi> For your Miniſters expounded the Covenant as it obliged them to ſet up the Presbytery in an abſolute Power; and the Commons declared the exerciſe of ſuch a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be againſt the Fundamental Laws of the Realm, and the Authority of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magiſtrate. (I might add, but that you little regard, that His <hi>MAJESTY</hi> in his Proclamation declared it an unwarrantable Oath, <hi>October</hi> 9, 1643.) And therefore do you and they ſee, whether the Concluſion do not unavoidably follow, and make a good uſe of it, I beſeech you before it be too late.</p>

                  </gap>oll, or look about, or whiſper and talk, as many do, methinks is as bad as ſtaying away. Nay, it ſeems to be far worſe, becauſe it is a more publick Affront to God, even while we are in his preſence; an open Scorn of his Worſhip, and a Contempt of all his people that devoutly joyn in it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for the love of God, never involve your ſelf in this guilt, as I ſee too many, even of the Great ones do; who ſhew not half ſo much Reverence before God in the time of Divine Service, as the people do before the meaneſt Juſtice of Peace, Nay, in his abſence, before his Country-Clerk. <hi>Lord, lay not this Sin to their charge.</hi> And as I would deſire you to pray with Reverence, ſo to hear the Sermon alſo with due Attention, and without any Prejudice or Paſſion. Lay aſide all naughty and corrupt Affections, which blind the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and will not let it diſcern the cleareſt Truth. Witneſs the Phariſees, who could not ſee the moſt neceſſary things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning everlaſting Salvation, though mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly delivered in Holy Scripture, and plainly proved by many illuſtrious Miracles: and all becauſe they were Covetous, Proud, Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, <pb n="231" facs="tcp:110369:122"/>
                  <hi>and loved the praiſe of men more than the praiſe of God.</hi> For what was more clearly ſet down in their Books than the time of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Coming; together with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters or Marks of his Perſon, when he ſhould appear? And what was more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be known than him when he came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them? In what were they ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd every way, as to receive and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him? And yet, notwithſtanding, they could not ſee him, even when they ſaw him. They reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt it ſelf, in the Prophets both old and new. They could not endure ſuch a <hi>Chriſt</hi> as taught them to be humble, and pure in heart, and heavenly-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and meek, and merciful, and peaceable, and patient under all injuries, and obedient to Government; and that would not oppoſe <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and advance them to Power and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. From whence you ſee how neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it is to follow the Counſel of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1. <hi>Ep.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>and laying aſide all Malice, and all Guile, and all Hypocriſies, and Envies, and Evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakings; as a new-born Babe deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word, that you may grow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</hi> Do not think I take too much upon me thus to inſtruct you. I do but repeat what I have heard from ſome of my Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters. And our Miniſter told us the other day, that ſome render the laſt words thus: Deſire the <hi>reaſonable</hi> (or rational)
<hi>Milk, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <pb n="232" facs="tcp:110369:123"/>mixture;</hi> it being the ſame expreſſion, which is in <hi>Rom.</hi> 21.1. where we read of
<hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſervice.</hi> But that I find is a thing few care for: As little reaſon as you pleaſe will ſuffice them. So their Fancies or their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be but tickled, they care not whether it be with Reaſon or without. Any little Toy takes them; and if the Expoſition of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is given them be but pretty, they never mind whether it be ſolid or no. Now this, I have been inſtructed, proceeds from a Vicious Affection; from a lazy, ſlothful, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of mind; from a lothneſs to be at any pains to underſtand the Truth; nay, ſometimes from all evil Affections; from a love of the Fleſh and Senſual things, and a too great ſtrangeneſs and averſneſs to all the Concerns of a Soul. And aſſure your ſelf, there is no ignorance ſo black and dark as this which proceeds from corrupt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. That which is the effect only of Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Parts; want of Opportunity, ill E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, or bad Inſtruction, may find ſome help, and be in great meaſure cured. A man of very mean natural parts, that hath an honeſt. Heart, may come to underſtand much. But this that I am ſpeaking of, being choſen and affected, is in a manner incurable. Men love it and are concerned to maintain it; and will not underſtand the cleareſt Reaſons, but ſhut their eyes againſt them. And therefore <pb n="233" facs="tcp:110369:123"/>if you would profit by any Sermon, come with a free and unprejudiced mind, with an upright and true heart; and ſo you may be convinced of your errors, or grow in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and underſtanding, and, finally, think your ſelf as happy in our Company, as any where elſe.</p>

               <p>Make no doubt of it. And the greateſt act of Charity I can expreſs to you is, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you how you ſhould behave your ſelves while you continue to diſſent from us. You were wont in the beginning of theſe Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, to call your ſelves the <hi>weak Brethren,</hi> This was the Language of your Fore-fathers, who begg'd that they might be forborn, and treated gently, and, like the <hi>tender Children</hi> of <hi>Jacob,</hi> driven no faſter, than they were able to go. But now none drive ſo furiouſly, as you. Nothing will ſerve your turn but to be the foremoſt, I mean, the Leaders of all: You would be Maſters of the Law; you would Rule and Govern, as if you were the wiſeſt and ſtrongeſt Chriſtians, nay, illuminated with a more ſingular degree of Knowledge, than any body elſe. It doth not ſuffice you to let alone what is enjoyn'd you, but you arreign it before all your Neighbours; you <pb n="234" facs="tcp:110369:124"/>judge and condemn it; nay, you thwart and oppoſe it; you would fain do Execution upon it, and having pull'd it down, ſet up your own Fancies in the room. And ſo far hath this Confidence carried you, that you would fain ſet up your Fancies in all the World, if you were able. For you know very well where you invited all Reformed Churches, and that in a way of Prayer, that they would aſſociate themſelves with you in your, or the like Covenant. I muſt deſire you therefore, as you love your own and the Kingdom's Peace, to have a lower opinion of your ſelves and Gifts; and ſo to abate of your Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and your Forwardneſs and violence to impoſe upon others. Set not ſo high an eſteem upon your own Models and Draughts of Government. Be content to obey, rather than rule. Let nothing of Pride, Ambition, Vain-glory, and love of popular Eſteem, bear ſway in your hearts. And oh that we could ſee all theſe evil ſpirits caſt out by your Prayers and Faſtings! Approve your ſelves to be Tender-conſcienced, by your tender care in all your actions to be void of offence to God and Man. Shew that nothing in the world but your fear to diſpleaſe God keeps you from us, by your humble carriage; by your ſpeaking well of all, as near as you can; by ſaying nothing againſt the eſtabliſh'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; by honouring your Superiours; by
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:110369:124"/>meeting very ſecretly, (if you muſt needs aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble in greater Companies, than the Law allows) that ſo you may not give a publick Offence. And I beſeech you never meet in time of Divine Service. Pray your Miniſters to ſearch and examine, as much as they can, whether none of their Auditors come to them only out of humor and love of Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and that they would exhort all that can, to go to the publick Ordinances. For which end let them acknowledge in plain terms, that the Worſhip of God among us is lawful, and far from being Anti-chriſtian; that there are many godly men among us; that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have received benefit from their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Let them expreſs their ſorrow, that they are not enlightned enough to ſee the lawfulneſs of uſing ſome Ceremonies; and deſire the people not to follow their Example without their Reaſons. Speak well of your Governours, and reprove thoſe that do not. Believe not Rumors and Reports, and take care you be not the ſpreaders of them. Keep a day of Humiliation for this Sin among others, that you have been the Authors or Abettors of ſo many falſe and ſcandalous Stories con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Biſhops and others. And do not excuſe your ſelves by ſaying that ſome Stories are true; for I can demonſtrate, if need be, that it is not the manner of your people to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine carefully whether things be true or no,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:110369:125"/>before they divulge them, but preſently they run away when they have got a Tale by the end, and carry it about the Town. By which means, right Reverend perſons (which is a horrid ſhame) have been openly charg'd in publick Aſſemblies with things notoriouſly falſe, without any ground at all. All which proceeds from your unmortified Paſſions of Anger, Hatred, and Uncharitableneſs; which make you haſtily believe any thing that's bad of thoſe you do not like. Let theſe things therefore be bewailed and reformed: As alſo your wreſting of the Scripture, and bold, but vain, pretences to the Spirit; in which, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, hereafter ſhew greater Modeſty. It would do well alſo, if you thought upon all the Contempt which hath been poured by you, or by your means, not only upon the Biſhops, but their Order and Function; and conſequently upon all the Antient Churches, who flouriſhed ſo happily under that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: upon all the preſent Miniſtery alſo, for whom no name could be found bad enough: nay, and more than this, upon all Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, for whom there is ſcarce left any ſuch thing, as Honour and Reverence. And now I ſpeak of them, let me again intreat you not to oppoſe their Commands, if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obey them; but only let them alone, and forbear to do them. And let this For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, be with much Modeſty, Humility,
